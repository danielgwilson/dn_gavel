  I am interested in attending Designation because of this complimentary approach. Ideas are important but more significant is the way we communicate our perceptions of reality. Artists are fundamentally communicating individual expressions, but aligned with entrepreneur thinkers, they could suggest more than a simple emotion or theme, they could evoke action and business through an accessible and powerful visual language. By attending Designation I hope to gain insight from my generation, one that possesses a unique foundation, being witnesses of a rapidly evolving world but also engineers of a more sustainable future.",,"Hovering behind the guise of an app, Lapse (2016) is a virtual experience designed by artist Ivan Dépeña that transforms the streets of Miami into an outdoor art display through a fusion of augmented reality, GPS location, and artistic vision. 
  What separates this experience is the imaginative continuum it encourages. Many products or brands incorporate both technology and art or design but limit the creative process to those doing the imagining. 
  Lapse begins as a lens in which the viewer can discover the artworks such as free-floating texts or virtual wind currents, depending on their location. But it is designed to push the viewer to not only explore a variety of ares, but to imagine their own world of reality.
  This virtual theatre experiences a set change and new director that can open an entire range of possibilities and provoke ideas in a way that inhibits exclusivity and pushes innovativeness.",Through a student at Princeton,,c278648b-98bf-4537-b1d9-1f9a2087b9bf

So, we first set out to sunglass sites and sunglass shops to see which styles were popular. Then, we made 2D designs in Sketch and on paper of 3 female and 3 male designs we liked, and turned those into 3D models before implementing the solar cell technologies.

It is the draftsman’s job to use lab instruments to reflect that vision into precision. The purpose of design is to understand how best we can absorb natural elements spread all around us. When you understand the objective and the context of a work, you answer the Why, and that’s when you think about the How and start to make it useful. It is that study that makes things not just usable, but useful. I think that the Apple Remote is designed well. Google TV devices introduced a monster of a remote control that had no fewer than 80 buttons. Apple, on the other hand, had seven. Apple’s Remote is just another example of the company’s emphasis on designing elegant and easy-to-use solutions. Apple always seems to think that a killer graphical interface is enough to enable consumers to easily access and control.

I found that there was a need for my users to point out interesting discoveries within content released by directors of the Batman movie franchise. The big insight was that the process of discovering these easter eggs kept the Batman community active and it made the process of waiting for the next bit hit Batman movie a little less painful. 
  
  While Apps like Facebook and Reddit allow for online discussions, one major issue was that these services had issues with keeping the conversation in context. The topic of discussion and the conversation would always be in either 2 separate pages or sections. The big UX challenge was to overlay the discussion within the content utilizing the small screen space of the smartphone.

There are no other pages linking the user to somewhere unnecessary and all other secondary features are hidden cleanly behind a hamburger menu.

  I have been using computers since I learned to read and been drawing since I learned to write. My interests in computer technology and artistic design trace back to those moments in my childhood, and today, about fifteen years later, it seems that those interests will last my entire life.
  
  Thus, I aim to build my career around them. Given an opportunity to get involved in high-tech and innovative design, I will seize that opportunity every time.
  
  At Designation, I hope to learn the skills necessary for me to develop and market software. What market niches for applications haven’t been filled yet? Which ones have been filled, but could perhaps be filled better? I want to leave Designation with experience and knowledge about the professional design process.","Last summer, I designed and built a computer-powered magic mirror out of a Raspberry Pi, a 27"" monitor, a two-way mirror, and a lot of pine boards.
  
  This has been my most enjoyable project yet and I think it involved a lot of design thinking. Because I built my mirror from scratch, I always had to keep its design in mind. Throughout the summer I found myself asking questions like: how does X affect the way the mirror looks? How it functions? In this case, do I compromise for aesthetics or efficiency?
  
  When the time finally came for me to leave for college, I had asked and answered many of these types of questions. The result was something worth being proud of: a mirror that neatly displays the weather, the news, and upcoming appointments.

How do certain advertisements seem to pull in so many people when the advert may not be directly referring to the product, like with the sad Thai commercials or Old Spice commercials? Then, how does one go about to fully appreciate what makes the design of these advertisements so great? I guess the ""too long; didn't read"" of it is, I want to be able to appreciate the ad I see on the street corner, knowing that I am capable of making an ad that deserves appreciation too.","In the making of one of my games, Memorial Path, I started the project with the concept: what happens after death? From there, I had to create a story, but how would I carry out the story? Who would tell it? So, for a story-driven game, an interactive visual novel would be the best way to narrate it. The user can then decide for themselves what their own ending would be. Now what does the game look like? In this case, since I don't even know what lies ""beyond the beyond"", a mysterious theme would be best so a multitude of varying colors was deemed unnecessary; maybe a slightly dark toned purple would work well. Adding some ambient music would add to the cryptic atmosphere, too. The game itself remains in the works, but I spend a lot of time in the background of its design.",,Through a friend who also has an interest,Thank you for your time!,bc0b9f6a-d92a-40ee-aefd-fffae2e8427b

  To me, design thinking means to solve a problem through design. Whenever I begin a project, I always address a problem and my restrictions for the solution. For this assignment, suggesting the negative effects of smartphones is the problem I’m tackling. My restrictions were it has to be mural-size, no text and thought-provoking.

Not only did I have to think about representing stars in an object-oriented way, I also had to think about what data structure I wanted to use to perform a fast 'search' in 3-D space. The data structure I used for my project was a k-D Tree, and I had to design and implement the structure from scratch. The most important feature of the design process, however, was to construct my program in a way that it would be extensible, as my other projects would build upon this program.

I led the editor team in facilitating a theme that both reflected the school’s storied history and acted as a springboard that catalyzed contemplation of the future. I chose to use “blueprints” as an overarching design element, because I felt like it allowed the book to be detail-oriented, but also contain a holistic approach of the school’s construction (cover page and theme packet included in portfolio Dropbox). I also led other foundational points of creative development, such as font and color scheme choice. In the end, the book became one of my proudest products, and I’m sure that the design fits its function, and that the student body thoroughly enjoyed it.",,Posted on the Brown Class of 2020 Facebook group!,The bees are dying! ☹,e10c85a1-604f-4d99-b1df-8464c4af774a

Having launched two startups, I’ve had my fair share of ups and downs; often, these were the result of funding (or the lack thereof). Funding is one of the most critical determinants of a startup’s success. Getting it often leads to more funding, larger contracts, and more traction, while failing to get any often sets a company back a few months. 
  
  Although funding is dependent on many factors such as the strength of an idea, or the savviness of a pitch, clarity in expressing one’s ideas is the most important factor. And that is what I hope to get out of Designation. Designation’s three pillars, graphic design, product design, and design thinking, all help to bring synergy between designers and engineers. It is only through this synergy, that clarity in the expression and deliverance of an idea can be brought to light.","One of my startups, VoltWorks, seeks to implement microbial fuel cells to treat waste produced in vineyards. Now, microbial fuel cells are quite a mouthful, and trying to explain the details and mechanics behind my product to investors has been a major hurdle. Often, investors would get bored in under a minute, if I began to delve into the electrochemistry behind the fuel cell’s operation. 
  
  How then, could I convey my idea to others, without causing disinterest or boredom? As I prepared to pitch my product at TigerLaunch, I realized that the key to my design, was to present my product in a clear manner. I ultimately created a pitch deck that emphasized design, through clean visuals, rather than messy text and explanations; it allowed the viewer to experience my product, and understand what (physically) they were investing in, rather than simply believing my word and my calculations.",,"I heard about Designation through Brown's Engineering DUG, which discussed the unique opportunities offered through the conference.","Startups have been an integral part of my career as a university, and as a high school student. I have been heavily involved in launching two startups: VoltWorks, which specialized in microbial fuel cells, and Pursuit Solar, which specializes in solar-powered drones. 
  
  I have advocated for my work in startups through pitch competitions, research, and rounds of funding. I have found that creating and conveying a clean and presentable design, is often just as important as the physical product itself. While a product speaks volumes to the creator, its visual design and aesthetic allows the creator to let his or her product speak volumes to others. 
  
  I hope to have the opportunity to attend Designation to share what I have learned about design through my experiences, and meet and learn from others who share similar interests and experiences.",4544e0d9-422b-4b70-bc68-a0718e78ba14

This has been a huge learning experience for me because we don’t often think of design as a means to tell people’s stories. However, through this fellowship, I’ve been learning that a good designer is thinking about narrative and voice for every design decision they make. Recently, through the fellowship, I worked on a project to think about how we could redesign technology use for the elderly. This was an amazing experience because it really taught me the value of not basing my design decisions on ‘scenarios’ and ‘personas’ that I’ve built in my head, because each one of us has so many internal biases that would hurt our design intentions.

We then got together as a group and created and debated over a dozen paper prototypes of the new microwave interface, making sure to optimize the layouts, words, and functionality in terms of learnability, efficiency, and memorability for the average user, while taking advantage of more recent innovations in touch screens and machine learning to augment the overall UI experience.",,A Brown University design Facebook group,,78520005-8730-4999-9d9e-c1062c189318

In particular, we wanted to change the way diseases or illnesses are presented to children for two reasons: an understanding of the condition will allow them to better take care of themselves, and the gap between medical officials and ""laymen"" will be bridged. As this took place at a health hackathon, we had the opportunity to discuss our ideas with various mentors.

Our final conception was based on research of the users and their needs and an evaluation of what already exists.","I believe Spotify's application creates a personalized world of music that allows for people to engage with the music they want to and discover new music. While this is an app accessed separately from web browsers, it does not isolate the user; rather through the friends network, people can connect and view what others are listening too. What makes this a good design because Spotify is neither one nor the other. It is neither a person's musical bubble, nor is it a constant social media portal. It is neither a place to store your favorite music but also a place to search for something new. It asks for as much participation as someone wants to give, neither acting as the only source of music but always being available to provide its services.

Working as an artist with glass has helped me gain a grasp of many components of design in unconventional ways. I often work with light in my art, and I am fascinated with seeing what design applications optics and light can have within architectural space, design interventions, industrial design, UX, among other fields. I like to apply my technical knowledge of physics in this way to find new applications of glass and optics as well. I think Designation will be very beneficial in understanding what opportunities lie within my interests in design fields. I hope it can guide me into what kind of career or projects I want to be involved with in the future.
  I hope to gain more experience with working on projects with designers, entrepreneurs, and engineers. I want to meet like-minded individuals who find the importance in interdisciplinary approaches to designing, and in what ways I can contribute and communicating using my own skills to a project. Coming from a fine arts and science background, I am fascinated with working in the application of art and science within a design and technological approach. Working with real world problems that perpetuate all types of communities and people is something I find very important and really enjoy. I want to learn and share with those who attend other schools and study different disciplines.","I recently took the course ‘Ash Mountains’, an architecture research by design seminar on building with volcanos and geology taught by Pedro Aparicio and Namik Mackic. The premise of the course led up to a final research performance revealing a design proposal set on a volcanic site within the Ring of Fire. Our site was the site of Mexico City with the volcanic area being Mt. Popocatépetl.
  We chose the anthropogenic geology of waste, garbage, and landfills as the geological substrate of our site. My group researched the recently closed landfill, Bordo Poniente, and the displacement of many waste pickers, pepenadores, who had lived and worked there and were displaced from the area. We analyzed the site as a palimpsest of anthropogenic geology which manifested in the physical geology of the Valley of Mexico, the bioengineered infrastructure of Tenochtitlan, the alteration of lake Texcoco in Spanish Colonization, and the landfill area of Bordo Poniente today. Our research included extensive contact of professors, geologists, and former pepenadores to help us in our research of the site.
  We created a critical design proposal which challenged Norman Foster’s design for the new airport of Mexico City. The airport is meant to replace the old airport and create a new once based on the history of Tenochtitlan and Mexico City. Our proposal suggests an alternative to better use the geological history of the site as a basis for the airport design. With both airports being located right next to the Bordo Poniente landfill, we suggest to move the airport onto the site as a way of recognizing the many components that make up the area holistically.
  To illustrate this cause, we created a glass architectural modal of the topographical area of Mexico City and a Mesoamerican inspired transparency codex book to tell the story of the site in its layered histories. In the end, we hoped that our design can shed light into the situation within waste picking and what encompasses a design which takes into account all aspects of history and geology.

I sifted through my emails like a dog that’s lost its way. As with most days, several pieces of correspondence had accumulated to vie for my attention. I was just about to close up my computer when a notification changed my mind. I opened the email to reveal a wonderful letter from a dear old friend.

Previously, the employees had to go through a 1 hour training session to learn how to use it and it was all in all, very unintuitive and on the brink of being shut down. So we worked on redesigning a completely different approach to it with the help of the engineer who built it and the troubleshooter who taught people how to use it. We spent three hours in a meeting room finally coming to a conclusion of creating a process flow for three main objectives, shipping, assembly, and return/receiving. From there, we split up the work and were able to create the sub processes within the 3 main processes by asking the engineers within the company who used the functionalities the most. It was very rewarding to see that the engineers were very impressed with the new look and change of process and how intuitive it ended up coming out to be, that it was even being considered to be sold as a enterprise software later down the line.

What makes it so great is that it's a 3-in-1 use sponge. It allows me to use the rounded side of the sponge to blend foundation on larger areas of my face, a flat edge that helps press concealer around my eyes, and a fine tip to hone in on contouring smaller areas on my face like my nose. It's also easy to clean and is more durable than its competitor, Beautyblender. The Beautyblender isn't as versatile with it only being efficient for larger areas of the face. It also absorbs more product than disturbed on my face, and its smaller than the Real Techniques Sponge which requires me to spend more time to do my makeup than I like.",HH Design,,8ab6f322-7796-4684-9863-d638a8823480

More specifically, I wish to learn about a more logical, systematic approach to design. It has always been inconceivable to me how artists, such as directors, musicians and designers do what they do, how they can capture their audience with their art and leave them amazed, wanting more. But just as Anthony Hopkins says in one of my favorite shows, Westworld, “Everything in this world is magic, except to the magician.” To me, this means that the more I practice design, the less inconceivable the art is. Through Designation, I want to understand the process of design so that I can approach it with less fear and more confidence, knowing that even if I am lacking now, I can always improve.","ScottyLabs, my on-campus, technology organization, decided that we should redesign our website because many have said they didn’t know what ScottyLabs does even after visiting our website. We sought to solve this problem. Since I was still a beginner at design, I had no idea where to start, so I decided to follow IDEO’s design process. After documenting the needs of our users, I moved on to researching examples of well-designed websites. I selectively collected ideas that I liked from these examples and then began iterating, constantly referring back to the user’s needs. Moving from iteration to iteration, I learned how important the design process is. Even when web design sounded so daunting, I grew by taking inspiration from others, openly accepting constructive feedback and learning from my mistakes. Through this project, I learned that the process is just as important as the result.",,From a designer friend that recommended I apply.,My heart is in the work :),c2a90cf2-4d34-48b0-bf6c-7035562d591a

Instead, the process was entirely human: we wanted to understand the core needs of human connection and communities, and talked with international students to understand what it’s like to come to an entirely new environment.
  
  The design research component really shaped the ideation process — what factors are most effective to bring people together? We investigated and read about how food and meals impacts communities, how people come together on online forums, and what makes someone want to reach out to new cultures and people.

Although it is a fairly technical project, leveraging IOT, physical computing, and custom software, the ultimate focus was not on the technology, but rather the interaction that it enabled. In this case, the design thinking allowed a greater focus on how the system allowed for greater social affordances and a smoother integration into existing infrastructures. The design thinking was that more technology should feel like less. The system was designed to empower intuitive physical and tangible human responses.

Good design is seamless. And great design, as something capable of systemic change and shifting of worldviews, is something one only ever sees the effects of.

This design has allowed my team to become semifinalists in the Mines Engineering and Innovation Challenge, funded by Newmont Mining. The initial concept was to be anti-vibrational, but based on the current market of gloves and needs of users, it has evolved. It is now a vibration reducing glove, which is also anti-abrasion, reflective, and moisture-wicking. The novel idea of the glove remains the same, in which sensors would be connected to lights that indicate when the user should stop using vibrational frequency machinery, like a jack hammer. This is to reduce the risk of Hand-Arm Vibration syndrome, which can cause loss of feeling in a person's arms. Another goal of the glove is to reduce grip force since an increased grip force can cause carpal-tunnel syndrome. The design process has evolved the glove to become much more user oriented and showed my team that the user is the most important aspect in design.","Starbucks is a brand that I believe is well designed because of it's ability to franchise and reach a large market.

The goal of the app was to be as simple as possible: one tap to order one slice of pizza. Retaining this functionality throughout development required solving a multitude of design issues: how do we prevent users from accidently ordering, how do we collect information of where to deliver to, how do we make functionality clear, etc. all while retaining one tap to order?
  While the app itself was beautifully simple, getting the app on user's phone proved to be a huge barrier to entry. To this issue, design thinking guided us backwards: we started pushing users to just Venmo us rather than download the app at first. We instantly saw an increase in sales, and once users were introduced to the service through something already on their phone, app downloads increased as well. Building an app and then proceeding to ditch the app for a different service seemed completely illogical, but design-thinking justified the successful choice.","Everything Elon Musk does in the realm of design is exceptional.

Recently, I've been increasingly interested in engaging with design to improve user accessibility (whether of products or interfaces) and perhaps consider new ways of addressing long standing social concerns in today's reality. I am most excited about the potential of having a community of passionate designers (and the immense diversity encapsulated in the field of ""design"") with whom I can collaborate with (a community I haven't been able to find yet)!","At the moment, I'm on the marketing team for the New York City Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC), an annual series of workshops (similar to Designation?) focused on political education centered around the APIA community. As our team is responsible for constructing NYCAASC's ""brand"", we've been directing our efforts in facilitating the relationship between NYCAASC (as an entity) and those who interact with it (primarily high school and university students in the city). These efforts involve making NYCAASC's mission, theme, and content more accessible (for instance, by making our language, both verbal and visual, more inclusive and less abstract) through our public statements, social media posts, posters/logo designs, and website interfaces. Because this year in particular we are focusing on bridging the gap between members of the APIA community with vastly different experiences (or “realities”, whether across gender, class, ethnicity, etc.), our work is increasingly grounded in those beyond the “university bubble” we operate in (including them in the design process and making sure we don’t stray far away from those we intend to reach out to).",,The event was shared in a Facebook group I'm a part of :~),Thank you to all the organizers for putting this space together.

One significant design challenge I faced was how to prompt the reading time information. An unanticipated pop-up is cumbersome for the user, and since Readism is activated every single time a user opens an article, it can verge on being annoying if it frequently takes up space on the screen. My solution based the size of the reading time prompt on various properties of the screen, and used colors that resulted in less significant clash with the content.","Robinhood takes something as opaque as stock trading and distills it down to essential details, appealing to millennial and experienced investors alike. Perhaps the two biggest ways in which Robinhood improves on the work of incumbents (a la Scottrade & E-Trade) are in user onboarding and in the stock trading interface. Due to FINRA regulations, a customer has to provide billing information and his or her social security number to execute even a single trade. Robinhood whittles the sign up process down to the bare minimum, auto-filling information on your behalf and giving off a sense of credibility (and, I daresay, safety) as you reluctantly cough up these details.

The app was designed to provide Cornell Students with easy access to dining hall and café menus. Throughout the project, I went through a number of processes including user research, market research, persona exploration, user flow exploration, wireframing, legacy integration, and finally prototyping all while practicing strong product thinking and decision making. Reflecting on my experience, I developed more than just my design skills. Working in a small team of novice engineers on a short timeline taught me the importance of communication, and more importantly, how much you have to invest in maintaining said communication. Details regarding this project may be found here: https://medium.com/@jonleenj/designing-eaterys-map-view-cfebe679a257#.3lxgqmmlg",,Mentors - Andrew Aquino and Katy Ma,"I want to take this moment to provide a brief history of how I became interested in design and why attending Designation means so much to me. I started off as a Pharmacy student freshmen year and the moved on to being a pre-med student for a year while taking a semester off to shadow doctors. My medical pursuits were heavily driven by my desire to create a positive impact on people's lives. However, I also had a passion for technology and loved to program and explore health tech innovations. And so, after deciding I no longer wished to practice medicine as a career, I found myself passionate about finding the intersection between health and tech and saw myself filling the role of being a designer in the heath-tech industry. Currently, healthcare is lagging behind in good design in the technology being used. I want to take part in bringing design into this field which I believe will translate to better treatments, better patient experiences, and overall better health outcomes. And so, to develop my design skills to bring to these industries, I am looking forward to attending events like Designation where I can share my passions with peers equally passionate about design and its endless applications towards improving the lives of others.",b14ab896-4c97-4688-905e-12b8b2640996

Prior to this class, I had only thought of design through a strictly aesthetic lens, and had only ever designed something with code. In order to make this app successful, I had to create a seamless and intuitive interface, which initially was an unfamiliar domain for me.

I noticed that there was a prevalent problem with the bus system on campus. It was difficult to figure out where and when the bus was arriving at a stop. This problem discouraged many students from utilizing the bus to get to their classes on a large campus. Thus, I set out to design a mobile application that would solve everyone's frustrations with riding the bus. First, I started off by doing user research; I walked around campus and asked questions to students, professors, and locals to figure out the core problem. Then, I started to brainstorm solutions and key features that were necessary for the platform. Next, I did low-fidelity mockups so that I can perform user testing and ensure that my approach was intuitive and actually solved the problem. I went through iterations with feedback and engineering constraints. In the end, I had designed a mobile application that solved much of the problems stated in the initial user research and allowed people to ride the bus more easily.","Tesla is a brand that I believe is very well designed.

In the past, when friends pay each other back, the most common option was to pay with cash – this proved to be incredibly difficult, as 1) individuals needed the exact cash amounts and 2) needed to transfer money in person.
  
  Venmo fills an important niche, especially now that individuals carry less cash and rely more on card payments. It revolutionizes making and sharing payments, streamlining it into a simple measure to transfer exact amounts via smartphone.

The app focuses on automation and deep learning, to give better, personalized results, and is supported by a few real, human shoppers. More importantly, Mezi doesn’t just direct you to a webpage or search results where you still need to put items in your cart and check out. You book directly in the app, which saves your payment, shipping, and travel info.
  Users communicate through messaging, so it’s a chatbot interface. That makes it super intuitive and casual. For common requests like booking flights or hotels or even delivering flowers, you can toggle the keyboard and bring up pre-set buttons. They automatically bring up a form with the necessary information you need to fill out. This speeds up the process so Mezi isn’t constantly nagging the user for more information.
  What I love about Mezi is how simple the app is, and how Mezi has a personality. There aren’t too many features, and the app interface is very streamlined. Just about everything goes through the chat. Plus the team has focused a lot on making Mezi personable and more of a best friend than a butler. Mezi uses emojis scattered through text. It’s hard to tell when you’re talking to one of the human shoppers that support Mezi – the app consistently uses exclamation points and a cheerful vibe, yet also is never consistently robotic, using different phrases and learning from each human interaction.
  I love that technology can make everything I do more efficient – and I’m excited that so many AI assistants are popping up, like Mezi or Fin, but Mezi truly stands out because of the personality that the creators strive for. The company wants Mezi to build a relationship with users, and be the confidante and go-to friend, and I think they’ve been very successful on that front so far.",A professor at Dartmouth's innovation lab,,088efeed-ef17-4f4e-a0c5-a6b022c288bb

They’re that a product's design should be innovative, useful, aesthetic, understandable, unobtrusive, honest, long-lasting, thorough, environmentally friendly, and as little design as possible. I believe that these 10 principles help define what a good design is. An example that fits these principles is Braun's entertainment center from 1958. The design is innovative as it has a much more modern design than other turntables, which shows how the design of the entertainment center is advancing design and taking it further. It is useful, as it plays music, along with it being aesthetic through its clean look. The design is understandable and serves a clear purpose, and doesn’t confusing the user. It’s also unobtrusive, as it’s not designed to be displayed, but is instead designed for the sake of being used. The design is honest by allowing the user to know how the product’s working, what materials were used, and that there are no hidden aspects, everything that is there is there. It is made from durable materials and it is thorough and thought through down to the last detail. The materials are plastics and metals, which makes the design environmentally friendly. For as little design as possible, he does this by minimizing the amount of material that’s used to create the record player, having a logical layout, clean buttons, and having the function of the button underneath it.","I recently began an internship at Drexel University working with the iOS app, Orai, and it was suggested I attend Designation to help further my UI and UX skills to improve specifically the mobile application even more.","I hope to be able to add to the conference with the skills I already have and also learn new ones that I can use in design, both in the digital world, and also apply it to product design .",7bc062e3-0d07-418c-9979-bea735b332fe

To achieve these objectives I personally interviewed team members, team leads and exec members and gave out feedback forms at the end of every general body meeting.

Interfacing with the Home hubs is a completely different experience. The key here is that Echo and Google Home have no screen and very few manual controls other than a mute button and a volume control. This forces users to interact with the device vocally.

As a user interface designer for Walla, I had to utilize design thinking to figure out the optimal way to lay out the app's interface. Examples of some of our considerations included: which icons and card styles are the most intuitive for new users; what visual priorities should be assigned to the various components of Walla's newsfeed; how can we ensure that the app visually conveys trustworthiness and humanizes strangers. After extensive research, testing, and iterations, we went from the original lofi interface to the streamlined and modern final interface that is currently in use on several campuses.","One of my favorite apps is Robinhood. Not only is its minty design so visually refreshing and appealing, the interface itself is incredibly simple to work with. Financial apps often get a bad rap for their boring and confusing interfaces, but Robinhood proves to be the exception to the rule.

Additionally, when I saw the graphic design component, I was further intrigued because I am currently a member of Duke’s graphic design agency and looking to expand my knowledge in that area. I realized that my interests in design and creativity spanned both the artistic and technical realms, and this conference is a perfect combination of the two. From the conference, I hope to gain a more interdisciplinary approach, using principles from one field and applying it to another to generate more innovate solutions to wide-reaching problems. I am confident that all three components of the conference would be hugely beneficial for me.","I chose to study mechanical engineering because I wanted to gain the skills required to design and build products that improve lives. As such, I’m constantly thinking of ways to improve the products I use regularly. When my senior design project rolled around, I already had a project in mind. My proposal was an improvement on a common piece of climbing protection. It’s called a stopper and is placed into a crack in the rock to catch climbers if they fall. Traditionally, these stoppers come in a range of sizes and are bulky and heavy to carry around. My solution was a series of covers to fit over base stopper that would save space and weight as a climber is ascending a route. Other design considerations include safety and ease of use for the customers and ease of manufacturing on our end.

Thoughtful designs, such as that of the color scheme, display how the product effectively communicates the workings of the stock market. Stock price tickers are red if the stock is down, and green if they are up. The background is a bright white when the market is open, and turns black when it closes. The process of buying a stock is simple, and thus pleasurable - Robinhood’s unique swipe up to purchase model eases the trade experience and makes it addictively fun.

  I've taken an unconventional path in learning and my experiences with challenging the status quo time and again inspire me to seek out and reach for opportunities such as this one. Look forward to hearing back!","NextBillion.org (Co-founder / Design Lead):
  NextBillion.org is a platform where people with visible and invisible disabilities connect with industry leaders for empowering mentorship, and access valuable opportunities.
  
  People with disabilities are the world’s largest minority at 1.27 billion people. They face inequality in the form social stigma, inaccessibility, isolation, a 50% higher rate of unemployment and a lack of support.
  
  I use design at the company to go through validation and prototyping at every step. We started with a strong problem statement, prototyped early to gauge interest, and interviewed potential users before knowing what our solution would be. Through customer research, surveys, interviews, and other design tools, we worked our way forward to launch our first mentorship program. I lead the digital experience for the campaign, and learned a ton about building truly accessible designs which are consistent with WCAG 2.0, as well as the ADA Section 508 guidelines on accessibility. After launch – in 30 days, we received an amazing global response with 200 mentor and mentee applications from around the world. We kicked off the mentorship program on December 3 – 'World Disability Day'.",,Facebook / Friend shared the link,Excited to hear back; happy to elaborate if you need more information.

While I know that my technical background will come in handy when making product decisions and working in a full-stack team, I’m concerned that I don’t have the design know-how or experience necessary to make a larger impact once I enter the industry. 
  
  Designation will first and foremost provide me the opportunity to learn from those practicing design and elevating it’s perception in their own spaces, increasing my scope on the industry. The conference will similarly provide a connection to the next generation of students thinking about the future of design. These two aspects are equally as exciting as I have found that meeting inspiring individuals is the best way to keep my creative edge and drive.","Over the past year, myself and a team of students from universities throughout Florida worked to build up a community called Florida Hackers. We started it with the mission to connect passionate creators across the sunshine state. With most of the founders graduating soon, we needed to figure out how to sustain the community. 
  
  Over this past winter break we set out to re-design the FH site, which was originally hacked together to show the calendar of hackathons hosted in Florida. This time around we were lucky enough to have built up the Facebook group to 700+ members to inspect for user needs. We designed a platform that would allow public access and input for the status of the community, including events and initiatives that members are organizing. I wrote up our design process and end results in a case study over at bit.ly/fh-revamp",,Was tagged in the post on HH:Design!,"Virtually everything I have learned that I use in my work, to build or design, has come from experiences outside of my coursework. My low GPA is a direct result of fulfilling my curiosities outside of school in order to better my skills and broaden the scope I have on my work. 
  
  As a result of these most-often frowned upon priorities, attending Florida State gave me the unimaginable opportunity to grow personally. The timing of the start of my education allowed me to play an integral part in creating and building up the student tech community through our annual hackathon, student tech group, and state-wide community. However, attending FSU also limited my immediate connections to the design world. The studio art program that FSU did have was cut two years ago, so you could say there’s a lack of design thinking culture on campus and in town. 
  
  To counter this, I have been lucky to have built up a network that has provided me the opportunities to grow and always be looking ahead. However, up until the end of last summer that network was mostly focused on development. Since then, I have done my best to position myself to become a better designer throughout the next year. I redesigned my portfolio and secured a product design internship in SF for the summer, sought out mentorship by joining the a16z Gen.D program, and am working to bridge the gap in my design education through reading. 
  
  Designation will provide me with the missing connection to a room full of like-minded designers that I cannot achieve on my own.",31909918-1249-439e-a3ad-fef8163d3621

  Having spent this past summer doing user experience design and customer journey ideation with Adobe Systems, I realized that I want to pursue that niche of user experience research driving better business and effective design for companies. I hope to one day join a company and change the way their products are not only being marketed, but are being made, from ideation to process to execution.","This past summer, I was tasked with creating a customer journey—from scratch—for a financial services industry company. My knowledge of the financial services industry was slim, but I drew upon my academic research and brand identity experience to complete the project successfully.
  The goal was to find a way to improve some part of the chosen bank's customer journey to increase revenue, and so after doing basic research on process for UX, I began the research. From mass survey monkeys to phone interviews to a plethora of published studies and articles on online banking statistics, I was able to choose a target persona and design the journey that would generate the most revenue and please the customer most.
  After many iterations, my team and I were finally able to design wireframe workflows and successfully present our research and improved customer journey to a senior director at Adobe.",,"A very good friend of mine sent me the website, and I knew that although it was almost the due date to apply, I had to at least try!","If given the opportunity to come to Designation, I would really take everything in and contribute my best foot forward. Being surrounded by such great designers and critical thinkers is something I think is so critical to growth, and I would truly learn and also contribute a lot to this conference.

I hope to be able to take skills learned from the conference and apply them to my everyday, academic, and professional lives. This is a movement that needs to be spread far and wide, in order to empower young leaders of today and tomorrow.","This past November, I organized and led a campus-wide event to promote socioeconomic inclusivity through student-led dialogue. In order to make the goals more tangible, I worked with the ""Designing the Future(s) Initiative"" at Georgetown to come up with a design-thinking experience for the participants.

The design aspect was quite heavy in this project, since we had to design a logo, a banner, and a website layout, as well as design a social media marketing strategy, interview questions, and framing approach. Aesthetics aside, the design thinking involved with framing the project heavily influenced the project. Our team sat down and threw around themes we wanted to explore as well as interview questions, starting broadly and then honing in. We also thought about how to best reach the end user: what the end user might be interested in reading in (e.g. political topics leading up to the election, personal stories vs broader themes, a mix of all three), as well as the timing and packaging of the posts.","The Obama campaign in 2008 was a very well-run, well-designed campaign. From the visuals (logos, iconic Hope poster by Shepard Fairey) to the branding/messaging (Yes we can/Hope/Change we can believe in), Obama was able to mobilize young voters and give hope to a generation that had been demoralized by establishment politics and a financial crisis. Its data-driven approach was also innovative, as it helped Obama target which areas to focus on/campaign in. However, when compared to the Hillary campaign, it does show that data-driven solutions are necessary but not sufficient; it takes powerful messaging, good branding, and charisma to really get the vote out.",Tithi Patel (Georgetown University Student),,a005b423-a98d-4b68-9fa0-8120d5cb4171

I'm trying to see where science could fit within the space of innovation. I also need to just geek out with people who may not necessarily be like-minded but who harbor the same love of good design. In the short term I want people in my community to become more creatively confident—i.e., aware of their abilities as designers, regardless of their current occupation or educational background. In the long term I hope to design for social and environmental good. In particular, I want to use design to think about ecologically sustainable systems.","Currently I’m working on a project to build two beehives on Georgetown’s campus. The physical product will be two fully functional bee colonies as well as—we hope—loads of honey. However, I am using design thinking to incorporate this project into a larger ecosystem of urban agriculture initiatives on campus to get people closer to nature and the source of their food. I will design the immediate surroundings of the hives to create the most amenable space for humans and honeybees to interact as well as to dispel any negative attitudes people have about bees. Not only will I have to be empathetic to other human beings, I also have to leverage a degree of ecological consciousness. I also hope to incorporate an open-source quasi-art project designed to make people more engaged with honeybees.",,Friend,,1b694ea8-17c3-4185-be07-518ff1ecabe5

My final project was a free choice ""fan creation"" in which I had the unconventional idea of writing a script for a VR experience linked to the Tomb Raider world. While this was meant to be a simple 10-page assignment, I found it invigorating and spent hours toiling over its 30 pages. Moreover, once finished I did not simply hand in a stack of paper, but instead created a website which carried the same cerebral/mysterious atmosphere that I had attempted to conjure in the VR experience. Although it was significantly more time consuming than an average project, this was an incredible experience which allowed me to stoke a constantly reeling lust for innovative thinking and alternative action.","I think Airbnb is one of the most tasteful, logically designed platforms I have used in recent memory.

  College girls typically go out twice a week. With the rise of social media, this number of outings means a minimum of eight unique party outfits a month. On top of this pressure, students require business attire for interviews, internships, and jobs. Because of these necessities, girls are constantly buying new items, while maintaining an excess collection of clothing that they could easily lend out.

After visiting the website and seeing the contents and the speakers, I thought it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about Product Design and Design Thinking especially in preparation for my internship.","My project in my portfolio website called Grocery HelpAR was all about putting the design thinking process into action. Not only we adopted a lot of the research and design techniques needed to approach the problems and try to solve them, but also we put a lot of work into trying to understand the potential users of our application.","In my opinion, a website called Dribbble is well designed. Unlike Behance which many of the designers use to showcase their work, I saw the value in creating one beautiful UI design to show others your skills and your creativity. Moreover, the design of the website is very modern-looking and pretty which I think has contributed a lot in putting the designers all over the world to use this platform to share their UI designs. 
  
  Lastly, it acts as a social media network which even connects individuals together from all over the world and as designers who sometimes struggle to magically come up with good solutions, we are able to benchmark some of the designs that we wish to implement in our own products.","Just like I said, I saw a Facebook post from my friend Katherine Liu who is also coming to Facebook as an intern. It seems like she heard it from Mihika Kapoor who also interned at Facebook!","Unlike many designers who come from design background, I actually come from a psychology background where things were different from the beginning. Also, I wasn't into design until last year where most of my work revolved around research and understanding people's behavior and emotions. However, I worked very hard day and night to learn many design, wireframe and prototyping skills in addition to the front-end development which I found a lot of my strengths and skills in. After I came to Georgia Tech for my masters, I tried very hard to gather a lot of information and experience a lot of different things related to design and information technology. Luckily, I was able to get my internship at Facebook which many people congratulate me for my hard work. 
  
  I believe by keeping up with my passion and interest as well as having the chance to attend these kinds of conferences and events, I feel like I'll become even more passionate individual who tries to solve problems for the people.

This was a group project for one of my classes where I was the visual and interaction designer. 
  
  The main issue with data related to schooling is that there is a lot of it, and extrapolating meaningful conclusions is difficult. I wanted to provide a tool that could effectively and cleanly display student success data, demographic data, and funding data for hundreds of schools in the metro Atlanta area. 
  
  I came up with three design principles to help ground my teammates as they thought about the problem:
  insightful and exploratory – provide meaningful insights through guided tour of the data, but also open enough that users can come up with their own conclusions; comparative – make it easy to compare schools, scores, funding; and responsive – every action has a reaction that changes the data.",,Through a friend,,389b009a-d5bf-4b71-b7fc-f1fec1ae5007

My team and I interviewed people with different levels of visual impairment, from slight impairment to complete blindness. Using this knowledge (and further research), we developed user personas and identified key problems we could solve. We developed the ShopSmart, and interactive cart with a scanner that could read labels and add products to the cart (see my portfolio site for details). It can be pushed or pulled to accommodate cane users and can read off lists of ingredients and dietary information. It also lets the user check out as they go rather than unload all of their items for the cashier.","There is a reason Adobe Creative Suite is so well-known and often used. There is no limit to graphics or illustrations that you can create on Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, or any of the other programs. While there is an initial learning curve to get used to the tools and options, Adobe is in every designer's toolbox because it allows inspiration to be infinite. In terms of design, I am a fan of its keyboard shortcuts and customizable menus, which allow me to work more efficiently. Vector graphics allow me to create any sort of image at any size and manipulate characteristics such as color, shape, and font.

Through days of fly on the wall observation, interviews, and data analysis (our affinity wall!), we (a team of 3) decided to make a shift on the goal statement, to go divergently for possible solutions that could solve the pain first, instead of feeling trapped by the monetary requirement. To scratch the itch that customers are in need of quick and convenient label creation and pickup services with a feeling of control, we brainstormed options, drew storyboards and invite our clients and customers to vote with us.

I wanted to meet new people in the summer, but I didn’t really know how to go about doing that in a place that I had never even been to. I joined a Facebook group for Bay Area interns, but it was hard to actually have conversations with people on that platform. So, I got the idea to start a Slack group for interns. 
  
  I started the Slack by first inviting the few people that I knew to join the group. Eventually, other people found their way onto the platform, and soon it grew by the hundreds of people every week. The Slack allowed interns to connect online and post questions, talk to relative strangers, and organize meetups with other interns in the Bay Area. I had never really managed an online community before. As the community grew, I had to recruit other people to help me moderate the group. Getting onto the Slack was a bit of a sluggish process, especially for new users. So, I decided to set up a quicker login system that would make it easier for people to join the Slack. In June, there were so many people on the Slack that the default channels were getting clogged with conversation. So, I observed people's conversations and started creating new channels based on the most popular topics of discussion. It worked in organizing conversations, and eventually people began to create their own channels, forming small sub-communities within the Slack. The Slack grew to have a life of its own. With the help of the other admins, I set up a strike system that we would use to moderate the community. After a while, people began to self-police, since even they didn't want others to ruin the community we had built. 
  
  I started the group with five other people, and by the end of the summer there were over 2000 interns in the Slack. It was an interesting summer project, creating an online experience for so many people, but it was definitely worth it.","When I think of good design, I think of Mailchimp.
  
  It's a brand that has never left its roots. Even though it's a multimillion dollar company that has customers all around the world, Mailchimp hasn't changed much at all. It's dedicated to serving small businesses, despite the hundreds of pundits that constantly badger its leaders to create products for large enterprises. Because the company grew slowly in the past and ran like a small business, it knew the needs of its customers. Mailchimp's interface is simple and clean, filled with enough tools to satisfy a savvy marketer yet easy enough for an average business owner to use. Their offices rest in Ponce City Market, a quirky, somewhat unusual set of brick buildings that houses everything from organic smoothie stalls to Chubbies Shorts stores to Chinese restaurants. Mailchimp is quirky, yet down to earth.
  
  Its advertising is also in line with its brand. Mailchimp doesn't sponsor hackathons or tech conferences. It sponsors organizations like CreativeMornings, a network of creative communities with different chapters around the nation, and Living Walls, an urban street art conference. You won't see giant billboards showcasing new Mailchimp products or Facebook ads, but you'll see the company's mascot painted in graffiti form on bricks walls around Atlanta. 
  
  Mailchimp's brand is something that has remained consistent throughout all of its years as a company. It's never taken on major investment dollars, it hasn't stopped caring about small businesses, and it hasn't changed its style. Mailchimp may not be the most valuable brand, but it doesn't care.",I saw it in a Facebook post on HH Design,"I would love to meet more experienced designers! I've never formally learned design; I started it as a whim in my freshman year because I was bored and wanted to learn something new.

The hardest part about designing a product is find the problem. And to find the problem, we need to think creatively. We talked to hundreds of random people, and we learned about each one of them. Then we began to learn that there was an issue among shoppers and finding deals. Apparently many of them get promotional emails, but how do they manage them? We thought we could create our own type of promotional email, but instead we decided to create an app that pulls all promotional emails, and presents them on the app in an easy, beautiful way to search.

Most of the students at Georgia Tech are highly passionate and driven to innovate and provide solutions to the world but often lose their way in the process of completing their projects. By co-founding a student organisation - Design For America (Georgia Tech) - I created a movement in engaging students in workshops that focused on social change and innovation while also teaching them the real world skills and process of design-thinking, which were skills that served to augment their own engineering projects to be more human centered and applicable. 
  At Designation I’m interested in being able to share my story of starting a design movement at a traditionally technical university and have it blossom into an organisation that drew interest from students and even from professional members of the Atlanta community. 
  Through my experience at Designation I hope to gain perspective from successful professionals in the design industry as to how I can carry forward my work in building a movement at Georgia Tech and level up into a brand for organisations in Atlanta to turn to for bringing the lessons of design-thinking into their project strategy. Eventually I hope to become a force that can augment industry in the South to a leading entity in innovation by design and I believe that there are connections and lessons to be made/learned from the presenters at Designation that will take me a step closer to that goal.","Design is a force that, when utilized effectively, drives products to be successful in the market. Often though, there is a gap in understanding how to apply it to this purpose. Is it simply a wave of creativity that hits a select few who can transform an organisation or product line? 
  Having become well-versed in the design-thinking movement I had learned that, practicing good design, it is in fact process that takes place over lucky inspiration. Moreover teams that are working towards a goal of human centered design can outperform the myth of a lone genius. 
  As I am drawn towards this analytical approach of practicing design I gravitated towards the work of a human factors professor at Georgia Tech. Christina Choi, who was working towards developing tools for both designers and engineers working in product manufacturing - so that the products they created would have higher chances of market success. 
  Under her guidance I was able to spearhead a research study of my own, while still an undergraduate, that delved into the system of the design lifecycle and sought to augment its efficiency in terms of productivity and results.
  My study focused on a simple goal - how to augment the existing iterative cycle of product design focusing on the potential of user feedback. The design lifecycle goes through many phases of concept generation and refinement. My hypothesis was that bringing users into the picture constantly would lead to bigger impact in the refinement stages of concepts, but how to effectively communicate the design concepts to non-designer consumers was the pain-point. So I conducted a study employing design representations like sketches, storyboards and 3D renders as assets to generate feedback from users. Based on the qualitative data collected I was able to map the biases that each of these kind of representations elicit in consumers and developed guidelines for the production of these assets by designers so that they could reach 100% of their potential in communicating the product concepts - basically a rulebook for prototyping. In addition to these representations I also explored the future of what the design lifecycle could be by putting before consumers augmented reality models as a design representation asset. From my findings it was clear that augmented reality is a pathbreaker in terms of effectively communicating concepts to consumers and eliciting detailed feedback due to the immense information it is able to present - visual, interaction and a real world presence. 
  This study was highly fulfilling for me as it approached the design life-cylce itself from a user centered perspective and was able to deliver a result that can help designer and engineers augment their workflows. Moreover I single-handedly created all the assets for the study - sketches, storyboards, 3D models and - the most fun - Augmented Reality models using Unity. I gained experience in conducting focus groups as well as analysing mountains of data and distilling it into actionable steps. The cherry on top of it all? I receive a President’s Undergraduate Research Award from Georgia Tech for my study and the paper is currently in review to be presented at the International Conference on Engineering Design (iced17.org) this Summer.",N/A,"I heard of Designation from the facebook group HH: Design.

This meant instrumenting each feature I launched in order to track engagement, as well as talking to users to get feedback.

When applied to projects like the Atlanta BeltLine and Facebook's Internet.org, these principles give rise to tradeoffs that designers must confront and become aware of with justice in mind.
  
  The latter involves applying ethnographic research and design thinking into a project that engages Auburn Avenue, a historic community for black culture and African American entrepreneurship.

The program, FitFuture, combines physical fitness with financial fitness by leveraging the existing culture around physical fitness and gyms to incentivize saving.
  
  My partner and I used activity-tracking meters and BJ Fogg’s behaviour model as the foundations of our idea – based on the hypothesis that people who exercise might be temporarily motivated to continue with self-improvement, FitFuture operationalizes those moments by increasing ability and deploying triggers. The program itself consists of three parts: a branded credit card, a linked physical and financial fitness tracker and a gym membership. As with calories and fitness, if people are perpetually reminded of their savings, they will be more aware of their spending and saving habits. FitFuture aims to have a constant, daily presence in people’s lives that leads to behavioural change.",,Springboard,I am so excited about this opportunity!

  In this process, I've seen how much of an impact it makes to engage personally with all types of people in your field, whether they are where you are in the process of growth or have made a name for themselves already. With both sides of the story, you gain a certain depth of perception that's hard to come by anywhere else. It's genuinely refreshing. 
  With design, keeping a fresh, dynamic perspective on matters of the field by getting these views is paramount. I don't just hope to learn a few tips and tricks in Photoshop for make a name pop out in a graphic; I want to dig into the minds of the people making that decision, and the million and one other ways to achieve that same effect. Design, in my opinion, is all about synthesis, and Designation presents the perfect opportunity to bring together people and products of all varieties -- and hopefully generate new concepts for the future.","This past fall, I went out of my usual comfort zone of digital and engineering design and took on the task of branding an undergraduate presdiential campaign. 
  The process was interesting; along with a friend and classmate, I gathered as much information as possible about the candidates and their platform and worked to find the best way to represent their ideals in a purely visual context. 
  The final product wasn't so much a mockup or anything of the sort, but rather a design language that could be used by the campaign to best communicate with their audience.

From the name, the curriculum, and physical set up, the team and I really put in a lot of thought on how we can make the environment an exploratory one, away from the banal and rote lecture style teaching in schools. It involved getting to know the students, paying attention to their interests, being mindful of their strengths and weaknesses and thus organizing our timeline, projects, and concepts around that. We taught design thinking too, to those middle school students through creating their own projects at the end to showcase: from prototyping/outlining to iterations to finalizing and personalizing. Of course, it's probably very different from technical design thinking, but nonetheless this has piqued my interest in design thinking applications.","Though I think the search bar right now is a bit flawed, I think Facebook has been well designed.

They didn't make advertisements stand out too much, brought in a newsfeed to keep users engaged as if they're in the small worlds of others and using the newsfeed as their daily source of small updates, and having relevant information on the timelines.

I've seen and learned so much about the power of design through working at IDEO, and in the past few years, the creation of IDEO coLab, IDEO's research and design network, has taken a stand that the future of human centered design will only succeed if we're able to harness emergent technology from an early stage to help harness its power through good and effective design. The power of technology and its potential for innovation should be open and free for everyone who has a good idea to use, but unfortunately a lot of our existing tech is heavily buried in poor mental models and technical analogies that create barriers to entry. I'd love to hear from industry leaders how they tackle these issues, jam with my peers that are at the conference, and learn from talks the best practices and innovative ideas on how to apply design. Another huge benefit to being in an environment of design centered people is the incredible energy and passion they have for positively impacting the world, and bridging that gap between different disciplines through design.","I worked at IDEO coLab on unpacking how blockchains would shape the future of trust and transparency, a sprint that involved partners from Fidelity, Citi, Liberty Mutual, and the Harvard iLab. My team and I spent a summer really trying to understand how blockchain operated and what the benefit in this new technology was (besides trading bitcoin). After building a few prototypes, going through empathy exercises (such as not using any forms of currency other than bitcoin for a week), conducting user interviews, and making applications to learn, we realized that this complex technology was really good at using a network effect to reinforce good behavior, enabling trust in a system and transparency at the same time. At the core of blockchain was encryption, but the human importance of blockchain was trust, and what creating security across a distributed network of people meant. As a team, we took these insights and applied them to various industries, creating a new kind of equity system for real estate (http://www.ideocolab.com/prototypes/fraction), prototyping (and issuing!) a new form of identity for disenfranchised populations and low banked populations (http://www.ideocolab.com/prototypes/my_id), and rewrote Kickstarter in 40 lines of code. 
  
  Technology has a lot of power in making new things feasible, but without understanding what makes it desirable, we lose so much potential innovation. This project, or series of projects, on blockchains, solidified my belief in the importance of building real prototypes to test a technology, and then putting them out in front of real people and users, and testing them to see what was desirable. Pushing the bounds of what is possible in our current world will always need to consider what is needed--especially the services, products, and experiences that people might not yet imagine that they needed. As we designed each of these experiences, around identity, and around real estate, we strived to make things that were unseeable, experiences that once you saw the pitch for and understood, you wanted in the real world, things that you wouldn't easily forget.",,"Through a former mechanical engineering professor, Dr. Daniela Faas.

First, I designed a “house” to grow the algae, inverting their internal clock in order to measure their light output. Second, I designed and 3D printed an apparatus to secure and measure the solar cell efficiencies under the algae, as the mechanical system and biological process had never been used in tandem.

  We used serial processing python script on a 64 core cluster to analyze the large chunks of data pertaining
  to each state of United States which we obtained from the “Apollo” online library (which was more than
  700 GB). We mapped, reduced and dumped the data to JSON data suitable for visualization. Then, we
  used HTML, CSS and d3js framework and visualized the data from the 50 states.
  I worked on both the frontend and backend. For the backend, I wrote the python script to parse the data
  obtained from the Apollo library. The script calculated the percentage of people in each state suffering
  from the health conditions. Later, I added this to a dictionary and uploaded it to a JSON file. For the

The project focuses on functions of cities given the urban systems, which can be loosely defined as any collection of independent parts that work together to make cities work better (or not). Examples of such systems include those that provide energy, communications, education, healthcare, water supply, solid waste management, recreation, and transportation. The very notion of city is undergoing transformation as new information inhabits and organizes the city and as humans occupy, navigate, and experience it through new protocols. Coupled with evolving green strategies and technologies, this demands that designers and strategists negotiate between increasingly different realities. We must consider the hybrid challenges that will be presented to the practitioner of the near future and for users, individually and collectively, as they adapt.

The user just receives a notification and can either answer immediately by clicking rating stars or answer at another time through a list of events pending score.

One student spent a whole five minutes talking about how his mother put one of his school projects in the family's living room. When I saw his mother beaming, it crystallized for me that we had to design for the parents too. After more research and iteration, we run a workshop to teach a group of six students about genetics (which NGSS has as a 4th grade topic!) by building their own personal aliens.

Fasteners were not allowed to be used so the chair had to fit together perfectly. The chair not only had to meet these specifications, but it also had to look visually appealing. I used Autodesk Inventor to design, assemble, and do stress analysis on the chair. Then I cut the foam pieces using a laser cutter. I went with a user friendly route while designing the chair in that any average person could put together this chair without comprising the aesthetic qualities or the specifications. My chair did hold an 80kg person for multiple sittings and was under the maximum weight allowed.","A watch is something that is typically overlooked in this generation.

The performance takes place in a warehouse with 5 differently-themed floors over the course of 3 hours where visitors follow around the plots on foot. Given that it is virtually impossible to witness all of the action over the vast amount of time and space, the design requires visitors to make crucial choices that create their unique experience. Wearing masks to conceal their identity and remaining silent, visitors can choose to sift through a cabinet of curiosities, watch Macbeth's demise, or brew up chaos with the clan of witches. At certain points in the narratives, actors break the fourth wall and engage in one-on-one sessions with visitors to give them secret information or solicit their help in carrying out a plot.

Personally, I do not use their products, but the overall customer experience that they have created over the past 35 years is outstanding.

They have made countless dollars by inventing their own Apple world where customers can synchronize their iTunes with their iPods and iPhones or play Apple Music off of their Apple TVs while surfing around Safari on their Macintosh computers. Even stepping into the overcrowded Apple store at the mall enhances the experience threefold. It is simply amazing that Apple has been able to break the consumer market and convince people that their products are better simply because they are different.

The conference will give me multiple outlooks in life, design itself, and to my approaches. What I mean to say is, that I would benefit greatly from being surrounded by motivated students and listening to their voices. Every mind interprets an item differently, thus sharing concepts and thoughts in the conference would only improve my way of design thinking and designs themselves.

I read multiple books on the musical movement (minimal music) behind the song, the musicians own characteristics, and even the history of the year that the song was released. I believe that design thinking is incorporating every discipline possible into your design. Thus, after considering even the wavelengths that the song creates-- 50 pages of sketches followed. The rest of the mobile came about due to trial and error in the techniques. From complicated ideas, my final work resulted to be a simplistic composition that transformed as it was experienced. By these means, my mobile became performance and an exhibition.","Benefit Cosmetics is a brand that I believe to be thoroughly designed. From the naming, product quality, and even packaging, there is impeccable originality by always presenting the history of the brand. Before walking into a cosmetics store, one can obviously tell apart the brand from others. I believe that they transform makeup to be a fun experience by giving each product an original storyline that goes back to the brand's history. To explain this phenomenon, I’ll specifically describe POREfessional collection. Even by its name, any person can notice the playful and inviting atmosphere of the brand, immediately making the user feel good about themselves. The theme of the item goes back to a themed detective from the 1970s that is to clean one's pores, the time that the brand was established.

Additionally, I believe that design only improves by learning different perspectives and gathering as much knowledge as possible. This is why I fulfill many interests while still remembering to relate my experiences in different hobbies and disciplines back to design. By attending the conference, I will be able to make my mind work the other way around, and focus on design at first and then be able to implement these numerous other interests of mine in the equation.

It appeals to minimalism, but also to equality: the idea behind minimalism in some aspect is that because it is simple and good, and because the beauty lies within functionality, products can be more easily produced. This means that products are uniform and more accessible to the general public. To create equality, perhaps we can provide everyone with a baseline standard.

Their purpose was to use outdoor activity to bring people together. I tried to build in the symbol of bonfire into their company name. It was not only concise and easy to remember, but also symbols their core idea of communiation and reunion.
  I had an internship position in a design company in summer, 2016. One of the project we design was the various board in Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The theme of it was autumn. After the brainstorming , we chose the body of the design to be feather. First, it gives people the feeling of comfort. It is also light which can release the pressure of the travelling people. Feather is also the symbol of fly which matches the theme of the airport. For Chinese people, autumn is the season which birds fly to south. Using feather as the symbol, we bring the taste of home to travellers. On the largest board, we designed a feather wing as 'hug' which people can take selfie with. It brings the communication between 'dead' board and alive people.
  We also added Chinese ‘mah-jong' element, using as number, to the enterance which gives foreigners the impression of local culture and gives Chinese a sense of intimacy.",,E-mail,,a05e77a4-6a11-453c-a7aa-525552b59779

  1. People confuse originality with innovation:
  
  Times New Roman, was not invented out of thin air. The changes it introduced were subtle but elegant. Although many others have created smart mirrors, I focused on the small details to set apart my creation from predecessors. It wasn't what data was being displlalyed--instead I focused on how to display it.
  
  2. Abstraction is essential to simplicity
  
  Design is effective and memorable when simple. By stripping down all colors, using only one weight for all borders and fonts, I was able to create an interface that conveyed information without taking away from the foreground. I wanted the user to only look at one thing at a time.",,HH DESIGN!!!,This sounds like a really awesome event.

Working with only people from one department - whether its Computer Science, EE, Architecture or my lab, I’ve seen that visions of the future often occur in low resolution. Though we can be experts in one field, truly impactful design only comes from a community of connected people with different experiences and approaches to problem solving. I know that Designation will afford me with the opportunity to meet more like minded people and apply my experiences to a new setting. Working from an ivory tower is great for ideation and empirical study, but conferences like these can place design in the context of the real world. After all, understanding the needs of people from mixed backgrounds is the backbone of empathy-centered design.","My belief is that good product design requires three core values – elegance, innovation and empathy. I’ve prioritized synthesizing these values during my senior year. For example, in my last studio How to Make Almost Anything, I designed an electronic touch-sensing ukulele entirely from scratch, from its electronic components and physical form to its firmware and software. It’s elegant – with a design featuring smooth curves and transparent acrylic, its body is a window into its electric core. It’s innovative – the circuit encoding its multitouch, multiplexed and capacitive sensors fits on a surface smaller than that of a credit card. But most importantly, it’s empathetic. With the goal of creating an instrument for young beginners, the ukulele is engraved with labels for notes, thicker frets for a novice’s unsure fingers, and a thin body for easier holding. And all three of these design values come back together in the form of a connected app relaying live data on strummed notes and their related chords, and generating sheet music in real time. With the app, unstructured exploration on the ukulele can now inspire organic musical composition. Altogether, the ukulele and app cost under $7 to produce.",,I got a link from a friend of an organizer!,This looks so exciting!,a92022ac-fdc4-4531-9e40-e12311e1df23

A good example is the Magsafe 2 charger for Macbook computers. Plugs are learnable since they already have affordances on how to use it. You can wrap the wire around two pull-out hooks and also replace the plug with a longer wire or different plug type; these two features make the Magsafe efficient to carry around (including out of your home country) and to use.

How do you indicate where another user is editing? How does another user see who else is also editing? Where do you put settings and information related to the coding editor without crowding into the editor itself? What makes a coding editor feel like one? Designing required a lot of research into coding editors (such as Atom and Sublime Text) looks and how other real time collaboration applications (such as Google Docs) look and design the experience.

The new color still conveys a sense of warning and grabs attention while no longer being childishly cartoonish. No longer self-advertising with large font, I can transfer it from bag to bag without being embarrassed. But the same iconic shape allows me and those who use epi-pens to still easily identify it. I believe the essentially same design was an intentional and good design because it makes switching from old to new versions seamless. The same motion is still used to administer the epi-pen, so I do not need to worry about learning and reading new directions when in a life-threatening situation.",A friend from school who shares with me the interest of designing user experiences shared this event with me.,,f3397cfa-0305-48ec-8299-ec62b79ed91d

We interviewed the leaders of Cacao cooperatives from Bolivia, as well as officials from various domestic and foreign organic certification agencies. From the knowledge we gained from their experiences and difficulties, we developed a peer-to-peer certification system that utilized the design benefits of the blockchain to ensure security, availability, and efficiency. This project required design thinking on two ends: first, understanding the needs and constraints of the smallholders farms. Because of the low reliability of the mail and internet networks in these regions, we designed the system to work with SMS on Nokia feature phones (the most widely distributed phone in the world). Second, we designed for the organic certification agencies, who required a level of trust and accuracy in the inspections. Overall, this proposed system lowered certification costs for both farmers and certifiers.",,Email from MIT TechX,,7ab10ed5-3ad9-44cc-a65f-4cedb151b3f9

Therefore, we created graphic design and college portfolio classes to expand their art horizons. We went beyond that and wanted to change the culture of afterschool tutoring programs, creating a new artistic program to teach regular school subjects creatively, with technology as a classroom tool. From these new changes, we changed the culture of the community to value design and creativity equally as important as STEM and pure academics.",,"Mihika Kapoor, from the HH Design group on Facebook","I love the message and goal behind this conference; I understand that this is intended for college students, but if I am not accepted due to my age, perhaps your team can look into doing a conference like this for high schoolers pursuing design as well!

Additionally, I hope that I will be able to design even better products as I learn more about the ideas behind design and the design process.","During my senior year in high school, I designed a 3D-printed microphone holder for my school’s drumline with my teacher and another student. Using Solidworks and a chest harness, my classmate and I worked to create several prototypes, each aiming to find the best way to attach a microphone to the equipment. In addition to holding a microphone, the device would need to withstand movement while simultaneously remaining compact enough to not be a nuisance during a performance.
  
  This forced us to be creative and to embrace the design process in order to create a great product. Initially our designs were both complete flops– awkwardly shaped, easy to break, not flexible enough, etc. We returned to the drawing board with what elements we liked of each. After I combined our prototypes into a final product, which after testing and a final revision, is still currently used today.",,Through a post on Forté Foundation,,6a8be704-1932-4154-8297-3698bc16307c

  Ironically, it was during hackathons and CS side projects when I realized that I didn’t want to do pure engineering anymore. Every hackathon, I got to experience the entire spectrum: product, coding, and design. It’s where I realized that coding was my tool to let loose creativity―it was how I brought my designs and ideas to life. What I actually enjoyed was product design.
  
  Throughout this past year, I’ve been trying to paying more attention to the design of things and creating more. I taught myself how to use design programs like Photoshop & Illustrator, and I’m excited to see what I can create as I improve.
  
  I’ll apply the skills I gain from the conference in everything I create, from digital art projects to side ventures to CS projects that I do for fun.",,"Side note: I also interned for this company and helped design & code its first product.
  
  
  There’s a startup called Shaper that’s building augmented-reality smart woodshop power tools. It’s a fascinating sort of space for a product to be in. Their handheld CNC router, the Shaper Origin, improves the process of woodworking―a physical skill that’s very manual and unintuitive―through the use of tech & computer vision.
  
  It’s hard to describe what the tool does because there hasn’t been a power tool of its kind before. I recommend learning more through our website: shapertools.com
  
  What makes the Shaper Origin so well designed is, well, it just works. It’s extremely intuitive. Users can simply create their cutting designs in Illustrator, and then upload it to the power tool via USB or wirelessly. Holding it and cutting with the Shaper Origin just feels good too. Power tools tend to be very scary things for people unfamiliar with it, so I made sure that everything the Origin did was predictable and non-alarming. It’s so easy and safe to use that we’ve had 6-year-olds use it to cut wood (with supervision of course).",HH Design’s Facebook group! :).

  My user group was disaster preppers, people who prepare for apocalyptic events. Starting this project, we assumed, as most non-preppers do, that preppers were crazy conspiracy theorists who stockpile guns. We actually found preppers who prepare for a wide range of events, from hurricanes to zombie pandemics by stockpiling food, learning diverse skills, and undergoing endurance training.
  
  We wanted to design something for preppers that let them practice their skills, work together, and excited them about talking to non-preppers about their passion. We designed a prepping league where preppers would work in teams, competing at local, regional, and national levels in an annual simulation of the world post-some event.",,A fellow student at Olin sent an email to one of our mailing lists about Designation.,,32aee5ca-8d28-4765-bd31-773d7374c85d

Throughout my time at Parsons, I have worked to created numerous books and zines; historically, zines do not have to be polished or look nice, however, when things like typography and graphic design matter to you, and aesthetics matter to you, you put your all into making zines and books. The book project that challenged me the most was creating a photography book of someone else's prints. This was difficult because I had to mesh my own typographic sensibilities with someone else who had an entirely different perspective.

Some of the solutions include:
  
  1. Cibo, an app that helps you decide what to eat.
  2. Limit, a wearable that tracks your blood alcohol level and connects to an app where you can set your own limits.
  3. Shortcut, a screen-based and card game designed to teach the user keyboard shortcuts to increase efficiency.
  4. Porter, an app that delivers food and essentials to your gate at the airport.
  
  This highly intensive process has forced me to brainstorm, ideate, iterate and prototype within short deadlines and most importantly, to work collaboratively. Each week I applied my learnings to the following week, creating stronger iterations and designs. This has led me to conclude that design thinking can tackle everyday problems, and I will even go so far to say that it can tackle any problem.",,"My friend, Vaasvi Goyal told me about this opportunity.","I chose to work in collaboration with a classmate for my Senior Thesis as I believe it is particularly fruitful to play devil’s advocate to ensure a unique product. The first month was primarily brainstorming unique and simple design solutions to these complex problems. This was followed by six weeks of intensive work on designing and prototyping our solutions. We set a constraint that each solution had to be completed in one week. If it was a screen-based solution we designed it to the stage of a clickable prototype, and if it is was a product we created physical prototypes and mockups. 
  I realised the value of getting stuck and failing as it forced me to evolve a more clear step by step process of ideating and iterating every week.

I chose to represent the field scene where Sam and Suzie first meet in Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom. I wanted to capture both the depth of the characters’ emotion as well as Anderson’s hand in production. As the book progresses, the pages get shorter and shorter. The blocks of text are meant to represent Suzie, on the left, and Sam, on the right. As you flip through the book the physical distance between your thumbs decreases, as the distance between the characters likewise decrease. The font was chosen to simply represent the innocence of the children as well as the distant role of Anderson. The bars of color are a mathematical distribution of the most frequent color pixels, a concept as obsessive as Anderson himself. Overall, this demonstrates how design thinking can portray concepts holistically, and completely.

Underneath that is a list of stocks that you own followed by stocks on your watch list. Clicking each stock revels slightly more information such as how the stock performed in the last day, week, month, and year, news related to the stock, etc. To buy a stock you click it, enter the number of stocks, and swipe up to confirm.

Then I realized it was simply the process of crafting a solution to a multidisciplinary problem that excited me. To me this is the heart of design. At Princeton it is very hard to get exposure to true design thinking, which is not rooted in academic theory persay, but in real-world problems and solutions. Designation seems like a unique curation of exactly the kind of people I can learn from: creatives working and designing in places of influence.

I'm mainly interested in social ventures and I would love to witness the various avenues people have taken to design for social good.","I worked on a group project for a class called Designing Ventures to Change the World, where we spent the semester designing a viable social venture. We developed a plan for a summer program geared towards middle school girls in urban areas in which participants would create a project aimed at addressing an issue within their community. We called it Wildfire, as girls would be called to develop ideas that might ""spread like wildfire"" within their communities. There were many different dimensions of design within the project and the class emphasized the process of ideation, so we spent a lot of time brainstorming the best approach to address the issue of the middle school summer gap for underprivileged youths. It was a constant process of balancing out-of-the-box thinking with periodic reality checks. Also, for our final presentation I designed and prototyped a ""matchbook"", which was the workbook the girls would follow as they participate in Wildfire. This required aesthetic, technical and organizational skills as I worked with a physical prototype to represent a more abstract curriculum.","I am duly impressed with the design of Venmo, which manages to present itself as a magic payment app while still maintaining the trust of the user. After initial setup, which is rather simple, every payment takes about 30 seconds, which is even shorter I would argue than swiping a credit card with a cashier. Yet this feature's innovation pales in comparison to the way they've made settling balances an increasingly social exchange. I never knew I wanted to come up with snarky descriptions of payments until Venmo showed me I could. Yet to qualify this as good design may be inaccurate because so often these discoveries are accidental, as the discovery that paying friends can be a positive social experience may well have been.

Yet, these two things alone would not have kept me being an engineer. What has kept me through the underlying math and physics is the idea that all this learning is going to culminate with design, which is what I originally enjoyed about graphic design. I learned that an engineer's job is to design solutions to unique problems.
  This recent understanding that the main job of an engineer is centered on design is why I’m interested in attending Designation. I hope to learn how professionals think, the steps they take to solve challenging problems, and how I can create original solutions for the design project in my embedded systems class, car lab next year, and in my career down the line.","A project that involved design thinking was implementing a Linux shell. The design choices involved decisions such as whether to implement a command as an ADT or an abstract object and whether to store information in an array or as a structure. I felt the design process and decisions to be very intuitive because I was familiar with using a shell. The Linux shell was a design challenge that was a culmination of my skills understanding programming systems. I have been using a Linux shell throughout my time programming for the class and outside of it which made the design process very fluid and rewarding as I built from the ground up something I used daily. The design thinking that came from this project involved deeply familiarizing myself with something only abstractly defined in my head, and realizing the consequences of design decisions I made for the final product.",,Facebook Post,,9ed2e450-dcc0-46d1-a733-cef95b28ed0d

I the brainstormed and modeled a ball pitching machine with a fan motor, an attached arm to hit the ball, a proximity sensor, timer and electromagnet which release the ball at the right time, eliminating the need for an air compressor. I loved the process of ‘rapid prototyping’ of adjusting the fan speed, the length of the column carrying the ball, the angle of the blade, etc to ensure that the ball landed correctly.

  When someone looks at a scissor, it is instinctive that their fingers go through the finger holders. Additionally, the protruding pivot makes it clear that the blades cross each other, and thus would cut something. The lack of instruction required for users is indicative of how well designed it is. Additionally, the simplicity of the design also contributes to it being manufactured inexpensively and makes it adaptable. For example, the simplistic design allows adaptation such as incorporating child safety, different sized finger holders and a serrated blade.",A friend of mine posted about this conference on Facebook!,"This conference would be a launch pad from which I would explore my interest in product design, entrepreneurship, engineering and intersection of the three further.",27da0095-8837-4f97-94f8-b25ca3e88d16

We would also provide school-wide events/giveaways for those sleeping the most during certain weeks.

Unfortunately it wasn't until my freshman year at Princeton that a graphic design course was available for me to engage in further. Some common misconceptions quickly flew out the window: logos and typography were not simply putting words on a page in a ""pretty"" way; poster prints were not necessarily the ""paper versions"" of what you design on-screen.

At the Designation conference, I hope to meet design professionals and leaders who may share their perspective for what creativity means to them and how I may go about pursuing bigger and bolder artistic visions-- even in the context of my intense, STEM-heavy, and logical-thinking background. I'd like to learn how Princeton premeds as myself need not be mundane and non-expressive.

I have no established outline, for I completely change up my designs on a weekly basis. The fascinating challenge is generating new artistic visions every issue that convey different meanings. After two years in this position, I am happy to have made it my own--and received positive feedback from readers in the process. Design-wise, difficulties of a one-sided 8.5-by-11"" confined space arise when I have too little or too much information to include in a single issue. I deliberately choose fonts that are legible from the opposite side of the table; I utilize negative space to highlight attention to different parts of the page. I consider a wide range of color palettes, which often must be adjusted as they appear drastically different in print.

I made the arrows out of wooden dowels with duct tape fletching, and spent a long time trying to decide on how to make the arrowheads.

I am looking for this concrete action and hope to gain skills in not only design itself, but also in design-oriented thinking.",,"As a member of the Tumblr study blog community, I have found the rOtring 600 mechanical pencil to be particularly well-designed. Jet black, with a metal body, and hexagonal shape, the product is not only aesthetically pleasing, but provides easy use for both note-taking and drawing. The weight of the pencil allows the user to work for long hours without stress on the hand, and the fixed lead guidance sleeve prevents the lead from breaking very easily. The packaging keeps to the minimalistic design of the pen with its triangular prism shape, supporting a principle of functionality first. I for one, am motivated to work when using this sleek and functional writing instrument.","Social Media, Word of Mouth","I have come to realize that problem-solving is through first-hand interaction alone. “Impacting” without empathizing is counterproductive because affecting change is not simply about getting something done, it’s about caring for someone else.

My pitch for this entrepreneurship class consisted of an idea for a venture called “LilyPad,” in which existing machines in India, which can produce low-cost sanitary napkins for as low as $0.05, will be dispersed, along with volunteers and educational models about feminine hygiene, machine maintenance, and raw material cultivation for products, throughout locations in developing nations to create micro-enterprises and sustainable economies. The “end-game design thinking” involved with this project was to target aspects of this issue that previous enterprises had not targeted before, such as the lowest income bracket of women in such nations, as well as a well-designed organizational model that adhered to the effective concepts we had learned in class.","I believe that Spotify is one of the most well-designed products out there. First and foremost, it has an incredible interface that cultivates the act of curiosity. Because it is so easy to discover new genres of music, songs, artists, playlists, and even people to follow, it also cultivates an extensive social network between both producers and consumers of music that continues to grow and is welcoming to both new artists and new listeners. Furthermore, because it offers both a paid and a free listening service, it does not alienate any consumer base, and continues to offer incentives to join its Premium service through student/university discounts, free monthly trials, and package deals. As an avid listener and lover of music, I think Spotify is an extremely smart product that is still continually evolving as the music scene and culture of music itself is evolving over time.",I saw posts on Facebook.,,a87c242a-cae2-4e69-8533-05f6a07f8813

Originally, noh performers hide the unattractiveness of the performer themselves using the mysterious beauty of the mask, which echoes perfectly with the protagonist’s countless hopeless attempts to hide his perceived imperfections in the play, and such mentality eventually lead to his death.

  It was nice to be able to actually build our design, because usually we have the freedom to create models of buildings in software programs, but it is rare to have the opportunity to fully realize our concept and actually construct something. In our class, rather than learning about how to simply make a functional chair, we approached our chairs conceptually and created designs that were aesthetically intriguing and original. My chair was a black-spray painted nest of over 500 plastic tubes, and took almost 30 hours to make (there is a picture on the link that I attached above). Each tube was connected to one another by metal screws that I drilled through the material, and although the plastic rods were very flexible, somehow by reinforcing the fragile tubes through a network of trusses allowed the chair to ultimately hold a person's weight.

For me, while I am a computer science major, my interests in design are not solely limited to programming and technological capabilities. After taking extracurricular art classes in high school, there was a part of me that wished to pursue art in college. However, later I realized that the desire to study art was not limited to just my passion for painting and photography - this desire stemmed from my love for creating and designing. Now, I know that innovation and design are inseparable attributes that, together, can result in stunning creations. Especially after working on projects that I have had a personal interest in, such as with Engineers without Borders, where we are constructing a water system in Peru, I understand that design is not only inseparable from our daily lives, but it is also crucial in our helping to improve the world around us, bit by bit. That is exactly why I want to attend Designation - to meet incredible entrepreneurs and other college students, but more importantly, to expand my scope and view on design and its applications, and to be excited about the role that design and design thinking will hold in our present and future.","I have been involved in Princeton's Engineers without Borders, Peru team, since my freshman year, where we are building a 20km gravity-fed, sustainable water system for a community in the Peruvian Andes. I was fortunate enough to travel to Peru last summer and that was a trip that completed transformed my views on project design. Throughout my entire involvement, I have been active in the processes of researching and comparing different communities to narrow down to a final one, creating different models for how we should physically build the water system, and expanding to see in what other ways can we help this specific community and its families. Now, as Project Manager of the team, I know that design comes in many different shapes in forms. Specifically for EWB, design includes the technical side, and more significantly, the human side - the side that considers both how to interact with community members and think from their perspective, as well as how to inspire others to join our project and work together to help others get clean water.
  
  Many may say that engineering design is a different method when compared to traditional design thinking; I say that it is an embodiment. From my work with EWB Peru, I know that design, in all of its forms, needs both analysis and synthesis as its scientific methods; it also requires both divergent and convergent thinking in order to brainstorm ideas and then narrow down to the best one. Yet more importantly, design needs inspiration - the one crucial factor that can spark innovation and passion. With EWB, my inspiration was ""the greater good"" - to do whatever is in my capabilities so I can help more people have access to clean water, a necessity of human life - and that is what I hope to continue pursuing with all forms of design.",,From Mihika Kapoor,I am so excited that this is happening and I can't wait to see how it can expand in the future!,6d6eb1d4-579b-46dc-8139-530418b80174

In my experience so far, design communities are incredibly powerful - maybe it's because we care about our users, and this translates to our peers, but regardless having these communities has challenged me so much. For example, online design groups have pushed me to iterate more often on my graphic design work and learn independently. In my school, our small program encourages supporting and challenging each others thinking, and sharing resources so that we all become better designers together. So, I want to attend Designation to gain access to a broader group of designer who can help expand my perspective beyond my local community, even after the conference.","Last semester, as part of my Design Thinking in Technology class, we worked on an 8 week project that began with the broad problem of enhancing virtual reality. From the beginning, we were user driven - we defined our users (college students) and conducted interviews with our stakeholders to help us understand the problem and narrow down the scope. After talking to the virtual reality research center on campus, we focused our problem on increasing the comfort and portability of a virtual reality headset. By the end of the 8 weeks, after researching existing technology, understanding pain points, and iterating on our prototype, we had created ""Headphones VR"" - a virtual reality headset modeled after Google Cardboard. It featured an over ear headphone set, which could be used and worn independently, and retractable antennas at the sides which expanded with a phone clip and lenses. The headset was created to be used with an existing smartphone. We increased comfort by adding a counterweight feature by adding a nested headband and using light weighting in the existing headphone band.",,Facebook design groups,I would love to attend this conference!

At a larger scale, outside of the small local community of Providence, I am very curious as to how design processes are carried out. Browsing through the webpage of the conference, the Graphic Design Part 1 of the event caught my attention. For the last couple of months, I’ve been fascinated the idea of Millenials. For studio projects, I focused on studying them as my users, and generating designs (both products and systems) for them. I am interested in continuing to learn about the topic and I am convinced that this portion of the conference will be the most helpful in enhancing the qualities my designs.","As an Industrial Design student as RISD, I have been using design thinking on a day-to-day basis. I have also been exercising it through projects outside of the classroom setting, such as at the RISD/Brown Design for America social innovation organization and Design+Health (RISD/Brown/Alpert Medical School). A project I worked on for a year and a half at DFA was designing a way to help formerly incarcerated citizens of Providence with mental health issues seek/locate resources. I conducted primary and secondary research on the discharge process in prisons, the reintegration of formerly incarcerated members into society, the homeless population in Providence, and various local NGOs focused on helping the formerly incarcerated. The process of designing I decided on was that of co-creation, where the design process was carried out alongside the target users. The final product generated from the project was the redesigning of the physical discharge packet that was filled with information containing crucial information regarding local resources.","I am a big-believer that the most sustainable design comes from designing systems that repurpose existing resources/materials. With that said, I believe that companies such as Zipcar, Uber, and Airbnb are companies with brilliant design models. Furthermore, in the exponentially advancing world of the technology, I believe that these are companies that have been able to recognize the potentials that technology had, successfully took full advantage of it, and precisely knew how to market their intangible product to a mass general public.","I heard it through Annie Klosowicz!

With this project, I along with my two other group members, would make design concepts of what the final design would be, research what type of material would work best in Miami's hot climate yet that would also endure the heavy rainfall that would occur and use that as a way to become environmentally friendly. After this, we would test out the perimeter of the mall and pick out an area where we believe would be the best place for our project, decide the overall height of it, and then measured that height against ourselves to better understand its dimension. Determining the overall use of the project required interviewing the employees and the shoppers aboutique what could be improved and implementing that idea into the design. Overall the final design became a temporary space that acted as a mall directory and a resting area that could be compact together and put away.",,Rhode Island School of Design ( RISD) usually post events that they believe would be great opportunities for their students.,That is all,0afbc1ff-f240-43b8-b3aa-eb854be5efd6

Granted, these are all things you can seek out by yourself, but to dismiss the opportunity to experience all of these benefits aggregated in one place is senseless to me.
  
  The architecture field has long been considered static, where large disruption isn't necessarily unwelcome, but visibly absent. It's steeped heavily in a culture of tradition and innovation comes from technological innovations that enable buildings to be more interactive, proactive, and responsive. Yet, this doesn't change how stale architectural industry is -- how a building is erected, who decides what is built, who has a voice.
  
  When 60 per cent of the world’s energy is used to heat, light and ventilate buildings, how can we change this beyond applying technological remedies that optimize energy use? How can we design not only buildings, but processes that aggressively influence behavior that help overcome these difficulties? These are all questions I hope Designation will help me answer or at least, provide me with the skills and abilities to find out.","Designing solution to decaying buildings left behind in Fukushima nuclear meltdown: 
  
  Japan is located at a major earthquake zone near a tectonic plate with earthquakes frequently occuring. Recently, Fukushima nuclear plant explosion and earthquake in Kumamoto have caused huge
  casualties while harming the natural ecology. Although parts of the buildings might be torn apart, most of the structures still remain. 
  
  After earthquakes, relocation and appeasement of residents, especially the elderly, are challenging tasks, and many are forced to live as refugees for an extended period of time in temporary shelters, greatly diminishing their health, although the greatest risks are to the elderly. At the same time, living in unfamiliar places also burdens them psychologically. ""Lonely Death"" is a phenomenon in Japan that affects the elderly living alone, a trend you see spiking in disaster areas. 
  
  My solution is to use remaining structures damaged from the earthquake and transform them into communal living environments for the disaster victims based on their needs; thus, the valuable memory of their old community is preserved, while maintaining sustainable building practices by reusing the structure of former buildings. In engaging in adaptive reuse, I can reconnect memories of what was once there and what was lost, to a progressive, optimistic future.",,FB: Events I may be interested,,92b35d2d-811a-4188-8b3d-df8f86feb000

After researching a bit about the city itself I figured the State house is design is inspired by Mugal Architecture to acknowledge the trade between India and the States for Opium in the 1800s. During this opium trade India invested a lot of time and resources and lowers the opium costs to cut out competitors like China but this indeed created more problems which include many farmers being in debt. Hence India suffered quiet a bit to be an ally to the states and help with trade between the states and UK. Especially with the current political situations and being an Indian myself I figured I had the right to explore this particular political situation and I decided to create an installation which actually is a fountain at India Point Park. A fountain indeed made best use of resources on cite (Water form the pond) and didn't block any open spaces to cause inconveniences for people or obstruct the view. This fountain could also be an attraction as it can be a performance in it self though a fountain show and be a place for people to gather during summer. I realized this is important as India Point park is quiet and scenic location in itself and is a nice place to bring the community together. This particular location added more to my project because it used to be the port where the trade between the countries happened. As simple as the idea of a fountain sounds it the importance of it.

Bjarke Ingels , the danish architect and founder of BIG , always understood the current population demographics well and targeted his firm and approach to the youth of today and added a playful dimension to most of his projects. As an architect he is one of the few who actually took the idea of brand image seriously and understood the power of differentiating himself from other architecture firms to decrease competition. Furthermore he understood the importance of incorporating sustainability in design as not just a boring responsibility designers have but a fun approach to design in itself.

At Designation, the people I meet, ideas we share, and prototypes we make will be instrumental in thinking about design in different ways which I will take back with me and apply to my future endeavors at Rice and beyond.","In my design thinking course, we completed a project to revamp the very first day of our orientation week. My group and I interviewed many freshmen, and we empathized with the awkwardness they felt participating in icebreakers. We defined their need as a way to meet people in a non-structured. After ideating, we decided to place students in teams to accomplish a non-stressful common objective. The activity we chose to prototype was a group of new students creating a pizza together. We tested this idea with freshmen who simulated creating a pizza using playdough and paper toppings while simultaneously meeting a group of strangers as would happen during orientation. We received positive feedback and improvements such as including open-ended questions as a conversation starters. This project taught me that valuing design is a humanistic approach to creating a better experience for the user. Currently, I am working with a startup to improve their internship program.",,I recieved a flier about this conference from the CSTERS organization at Rice University.,"This event is extremely unique by bringing a niche set of students who are interested in design thinking. I have recently become super involved with applying design thinking to aspects of the life around me, and I would be extremely excited to attend Designation. I am a great conference candidate because of my prior experience in design, leadership, the way I embrace change, and passion for excellence.

I was so passionate about that work that I had been working over time during that time. I could not believe how energetic I was when doing the design work. Therefore I have been always thinking of becoming a UI/UX designer in the future. I think the design is the key factor to the customer. The design can only come from human being, not machine or robot at all. The standard of a good design is the most treasurable thing of human being. Therefore I really want to learn from the conference about what is a good design, how to have a good design and what is the design flow be like.","During my summer internship, I was assigned a project to develop a component for a major app which aimed to show customer’s profile. It was totally on my own to decide what information should be shown and how the layout was like. I first did some research with some customers about what they liked to see and what interaction they expected. And then I analyzed the feedback and discussed with my manager to finalize my visual design. Then I tried to program it out. It was really challenging to me since I never designed a product on my own. But I learned a lot from the experience about what the customers expected and how to balance the feasibility and design. And finally it turned out the board liked my product and it was delivered too.","I really like WeChat, a Chinese social media app. I think it is really well designed because of the following things. First, the interface is really simple and intuitive. It is quick and easy to open up a new chat, pay money, buy tickets and so on. Its theme color, white and green, gives us a fresh, healthy and energetic feeling. It has a good amount of blanks and intervals which makes the interface is easily read and clearly laid out. Second, it keeps a good privacy for the user. It is allowed to share moments privately with your friends and all our moments can only be seen by our friends. Third, it separates the advertisement or any public subscribing news completely with our friends’ moments. Thus we will not be disturbed by those huge amounts of news that we do not care much.",Club annoucement.,,ae5427e3-d192-4a27-a8d8-fec4c6c44166

  Across my (brief) adult life, I've worked as an entrepreneur, design thinker, curriculum developer, and advocate for change in how we teach students. Sir Ken Robinson was right - schools *do* kill creativity, and to keep our generation and those who will follow us ready for the challenges ahead, we need to work together to build new tools and projects to spread design thinking further.
  
  What's fascinating to me about Designation isn't just the great speakers who are on the agenda, but getting to meet other talented designers from across the country, each coming from different backgrounds and schools. I want to be able to bounce off ideas and interact with students like me who live and love design, an opportunity that I don't always have at my disposal.","Most recently, I co-founded an education technology company called Solver Labs - we've built an online platform that catalogs and presents students with real-world business/design problems to solve, and also gives them the chance to share the story of how they navigated the design process in a custom-built portfolio so they can find jobs, internships, and other opportunities. Put simply, it's a crowdsourced consultancy for companies and an awesome real-world learning opportunity for students.
  
  Solver Labs was built through over a year of research, testing, and iteration - we got to apply the design thinking process to building a platform for design thinking. When we began work, we built a low-tech MVP (contacting schools and companies via email), then a Wordpress site to test out features of the platform, and now we've rebuilt our platform on Node.js and React so we're ready to scale. 
  
  While we're still mainly in stealth, we've started beta testing our program in classrooms across 50+ schools in the US, and after our recent presentation at SXSWedu, interest has skyrocketed. To meet that demand, we're going to need to return to the drawing board as we build new functionality and continue to test and iterate upon our portfolio creator to make it better for students and companies - design thinking's gotten us this far, and it'll get us to market too.",,I heard about Designation from a former investor and friend who currently works in business operations at Google.,,027ae32a-a3dd-42e1-9aa4-b412eff73bff

As an intern, I was given the opportunity to craft my own tagline and brand voice for their GeForce graphic cards line, deliver an accompanying key visual to reflect my brand narrative, and simultaneously conceptualize and animate a product launch video to tie the whole campaign together. As a student of multidisciplinary pursuits at UCLA, I wanted to translate my own experiences of creativity drawn from seemingly disparate backgrounds into a way to bring a unified voice to NVIDIA’s core audiences of gamers, scientists, and creatives.
  
  My tagline was simple: ""Engineering Creativity.""
  
  In my campaign, I explored how engineering and creative culture have a lot of parallels. In both fields, there is no one linear path to truth - instead, true innovation comes through persistence, passion, and collaboration. Drawing upon research from courses I had taken in UCLA’s Cognitive Science department, I drew a scientific basis for similarity between both groups by showing that brain activity for problem solving in both seemingly disparate professions often mirrors each other. Subsequently, I visualized NVIDIA's GeForce GTX graphics card as a harmony between left brain and right brain thinking, as both engineering and creativity work together simultaneously to innovate in the digital world.",,Through a FB post on HH Design!,If you have any questions feel free to contact me at rnshaffer@ucla.edu or connect with me on Facebook at @Ruth Shaffer,d182f663-ffe6-4f8a-b279-8df7a6e03dbf

The key to a great user experience is linking form to function - with limited screen real estate, they focus on what I need to know and which moments I need to know it. To me, that's powerful design.","I heard about it on Facebook, in the HH Design group! :)",Thank you for something like this together - I love design + conferences!,de3b9a74-c29c-4992-8954-c8e02ffd1bd7

The concept of Fast Passes also helps with lines - they're free, so there's no barrier to entry - and families can use them to better plan their days.

I am the design lead, I work on the front end development, and spend lots of time thinking and refining our user testing, user understanding, and product. It is a project that my group of very good friends and I started, and aside from gaining technical experience in using React, Firebase, and Material UI, we are gaining so much experience in working with very different people from multiple disciplines, making the best long-term decisions, incorporating feedback and critique, and user testing. 
  
  Version 1 of AroBooks was a prototype designed and built in three weeks with the app’s most basic functionalities: search and ease of use. It was missing so many things (you couldn’t edit or delete posts. People would just have to email us to delete things, not that that occured) and had so many problems, but we wanted to know whether people would even use such a service. After its launch, I planned and conducted a user test on a university campus. The objective was to test the design and the responses to AroBooks as a service. Some questions include: What makes them contact/not contact a seller? Why do people leave the website? Are things where people expect them to be? Are people able to see how AroBooks can help them? After the user test, I wrote an extensive report on our test procedure, key findings, and suggestions moving forward. Based on our online feedback and user test results, we went about starting to make an “actually good one” with the redesign.
  
  The design of Version 1 was user specific. We wanted Facebook textbook exchange users to easily migrate over to AroBooks. I prioritized ease of use; can I achieve the least amount of clicks for the user to get to where they want? In Version 2, I conceptualized on a high level model before jumping into a high fidelity mock; I wanted to use design as a tool to make the AroBooks webpage reliable and secure, make the market busy, and increase user retention.","I want to talk about Udacity’s website: 
  It has such a strong udacity brand, i’ve never seen anything like it before. For their rebranding, Media labs came up with mockups that udacity took a lot of inspiration from, but they certainly did things their way. They took out the two cards at the very center, so they’re going in a very strong direction of flat design as you see when you start scrolling. But this also involves less clear visual hierarchy because the transition between above the fold and below the fold is quite jarring. They use a very strong blue color and a strong green, and their use of shapes is very minimalistic, which makes it easy to process the information.
  
  If you click on the nanodegree link at the top, they use cards for their programs. There’s not as much unity as I’d like to see. The Nanodegrees page instead looks like it was built from scratch, they’re not using components for unity.
  
  My favorite thing is how strong of a personality it has. Most websites don’t have that. How can i come up with unique stuff and not copy other people…. Make my own stuff that is unique and looks amazing? Apple is very good at that as well in both software and hardware. My critique of Google would be that they produce lots of cool and interesting things you haven’t seen before, but i don’t like to use them. They’re not immediately user friendly, some of their products require a high learning curve such as google analytics for example.",Women in Computer Science club email,"I can make beautiful mockups and user flows that make sense to the user and to the engineers building them because I’ve designed and built web apps before. I have an idea of how the designs will be built, what’s possible, and which parts will slow down the loading of a webpage, which allows me to create designs that are strong, easy to use, and pleasing to see. Design for me is very intuitive. As a child, I would design and create fashion magazines on spiral notebooks. As a teenager, I would always personalize and design my Myspace page by hard coding in fonts and colors to get a certain look. I believe UX design is a natural progression of this intuition as I'm entering adulthood. 
  
  Being able to articulate my design decisions to stakeholders is an area I want to improve in. I want to learn to argue for my design decisions and support them with data and provide a story that stakeholders can understand and connect with. Presenting a final design and not being able to talk about it makes all the work that you put in futile. I want to excel in articulating my thought process and I want to be able to take my stakeholders on a journey when I’m presenting my designs.",141713ab-247f-4f42-8de7-731136b05a56

The project seeks to explore new patterns of interaction for student collaboration to bring into Microsoft Office. Octopal is essentially a no-chore messaging app for students, designed with their pain points in mind.
  
  Using smart keywords such as !meet, !task or !file, students can easily schedule a meeting, check off a task or view their files inside the chat, without switching to another screen or app. Octopal scans through students' schedules to automatically suggest meeting times and save time messaging back and forth. The app allows students to drag their chat bubbles, pictures and messages into a document and create a first draft that they can refine later on desktop devices. I did mostly everything in this project: brainstorming (this was done with a few other Microsoft designers), sketching, visual design, prototyping, presenting and getting user feedback.

  Rosetta Stone's revenue has been declining due to people who are switching over to applications that are free and providing the same experience. We asked ourselves, what if we could take language learning outside of just the application? What if we could incorporate travel with language learning? People learn best when they are immersed in the environment and forced to speak the language.
  
  The final concept application is a language learning app with a built-in translator. It would collect the data that the person has asked to translate and create a custom lesson for them to help improve for the future.","The Ossidiana Espresso Coffee Maker is a very well design product. Every detail on this product has a meaning and purpose for it. For example, the different sizes of the indentations is an ergonomically-designed coffee maker to grip and take apart. The spout adapts to its origin from the Bialetti, in which the coffee flows down naturally when poured. Also the indentation of the handle was designed to pour easily without burning one's hand. The inside marks lines of how much water or coffee beans that should be put inside to create the ""perfect"" cup of coffee, adding too much or too little would affect the taste.",A friend shared it on a Design group on Facebook.,,0a51848b-ef8c-42b0-9ced-ca7296febd56

In IMTA, fed species (e.g. finfish) are grown with nutrient extractive plants, primarily macroalgae. The nitrogen and phosphorus from the waste of the cultured species provide optimal conditions for the algae, leading to faster growth. In return, the algae generate oxygen gas, creating a mutually beneficial interaction between the species.

As part of this team, I have pioneered development of IMTA systems that are more efficient and more cost-effective than traditional filtration methods.","I believe ""green bonds"" are extremely well designed. These products, first launched in 2008, create a win-win solution for investors, debt issuers, and environmental activists. Investors, for example, know they are purchasing an investment that is benefiting the planet, whether through implementation of a renewable energy project, construction of a green building, etc. Similarly, debt issuers have an easier time raising capital for sustainable projects, helping companies (and governments) initiate “green” projects. These bonds thus create proper motivations for debt issuers – initiate green projects and increase your chances of receiving funding. This could incentivize debt issuers to begin more green projects, as interest rates are already at record-low levels. The green bond industry is already booming and set to keep expanding in upcoming years. For example, Stanford professor Ian Monroe created “Etho Capital,” a fund that only invests in “green” companies.",School advisor recommended I apply,"I write market analyses in my free time, often on tech sectors, so please let me know if you would like to see my work!",6019f63b-32e3-4588-a665-79d48c551a5f

I have spent the last two years finding a balance between the frameworks behind design thinking and the engineering skills behind product design that I implement in my work. In those areas, I am curious to work with the mentors, specifically Daniel Burka and Jamie Myrold, to gain more clarity in how these concepts played a role in the many companies they’ve hand their hands in. 
  
  I’ve learned the importance of storytelling through many makeathons and design sprints and am now trying to dive into graphic design. I developed a comprehensive Visual Brand Book for Stanford’s largest entrepreneurial group as a way to test the aesthetic change I could create. Now, I’m enthused by the idea of learning from other Designation attendees who have better insight into this process and learning more fundamentals in the graphic design workshops.","Imagine a campus full of extravagant fountains that pulse with the life of students relaxing on hot, sunny days…in a drought. Observing the dismay caused by the unused fountains at Stanford last year, a team of curious freshman and I decided to invent something that mimicked the fountains, but through lights and electricity, not water. It started as a crude, 3-inch prototype I made with two LEDs and a handful of stolen Boba straws. We built up the product like a startup with defined teams but undefined roles, constant testing, and a vision of our fountain’s impact. Our final creation, made of six, six-foot acrylic tubes, strips of RGB LEDs, and a circular, metallic base, now sits in an arts-themed dorm where people dance around it as it dynamically reacts to the music playing and the people around it. We couldn’t be more proud.

While I am grateful for the opportunity to go to a school with an extremeley well recognized design philosophy, I don't think I should be satisfied by only exposing myself to one philosophy. Collaborating, bringing together experts, being excited by the world around us, that's what we do best as designers, and I don't think it should be any different when it comes to learning about the field. Designation presents an amazing opportunity to not only hear from experts but to engage with passionate design students from across the country.

Yet, there are products that few would argue are well designed even if they wouldn't purchase them, and I believe it all comes down to filling the needs of a user group. That user group isn't going to include everyone, but as a designer, it's most important to understand those you are designing for. Because of this, the brands I'm most impressed with are those that become successful, that truly hit on fundamental user needs, but do so first with skepticism from the user group. I've played the violin since I was three, and over the years I've watched Bam string cases gradually take the market by storm. It's not to say everyone used to hate their products, but they chose a difficult user group for groundbreaking innovations. Classical music communities are steeped in tradition, and the craftsmanship of cases dates back nearly as long as the instruments themselves. While cheap student cases come off factories lines by the thousands, committed players turn to hand-crafted, Italian cases made of leather, silk, and velvet to protect their instruments as well as add a touch of luxury. Bam cut all that away, turning to new manufacturing processes to create cases with molded plastics and injected foams. First and foremost, they're functional, and they made every choice they could to make them as light as possible. They took out compartments found on every competitor's cases, they took out music pouches, they even turned around the orientation of the bow and removed the protective blanket over the violin. The mass manufactured cases stripped of luxury and comforts found in all of their competitor’s products weren’t even priced low enough to compete with most other mass produced cases, and yet, I’ve never seen anyone go back after owning one. It’s strange at first, uncomfortable even, but they designed exactly the functionality their users actually need, and they prioritized comfort in taking their instruments anywhere, something previously disregarded. They managed to completely disrupt a market where tradition, craftsmanship, and trust are absolutely essential when musicians trust their most valuable possessions to their product, and they did it by ignoring every other product on the market. That, to me, is an amazingly designed product.",I heard about it through a design school mailing list.,"When creating the application for a class he teaches, my friend added a final question requesting a joke from the applicant.

It is an eight foot tall steel structure that supports a cushioned ring.

I wanted the chair to convey what the house had helped me feel -- confident, cuddly, and comfortable. Almost every time I have mentioned this to someone, they smile and snuggle deeper into the chair. While I have been involved with many projects that have taught me about how people think and how to help shape behaviour -- projects I have felt incredibly lucky to be a part of -- this chair stands out to me because I was able to share my own emotions through a physical object in such a way that other people felt it too.",,I received an email from my school,"I have experience working to bring human-centered design into the core methodology of several start-ups.

Initially, I coded the app in a few days, and shipped it off with no forethought about the design at all. However, after talking with other users of my app and friends who I contacted, I learned that the user experience was vital, and all the little animations, color schemes, and button designs that I previously ignored were actually what made the app magical. Now, if any user searches LinkUp on the app store, they will see a clean, simple UI that puts design and the consumer first.","A brand that I believe is well-designed is The Fifth. The Fifth is primarily a watch company; however, what differentiates them from other companies is their branding and exclusivity. Despite having one of the sleekest watches on the market, The Fifth only sells their watches 5 days in a month, leading the consumers to believe that their product is limited edition and posh. Apart from that, the packaging in which the watch comes makes the product even better, and when I first received my watch, it seemed as if I was opening a brand new Rolex, even though the watch was only around $100.

I have gathered significant experience in each of these areas, through internships, class projects, and personal side projects. I hope to garner new design tools and practices that will help me view design thinking in a new way. I am curious to see what other creative ways students and leaders carry out the need finding process and test their prototypes. Most importantly, I would love to get to know the coordinators of the program and learn what it took to organize this event, as I believe this could be an important and valuable experience for everyone.",,"A great podcast that I've been listening to recently is NPR's 'How I Built This' where innovators, entrepreneurs, and idealists talk about how they started their successful businesses. My favorite episode was when Airbnb's co-founder, Joe Gebbia, talked about the immense difficulties and challenges of getting people to invite strangers to their home. I loved this episode because it was an exemplary case of a successful product developed through the design thinking process. I learned how useful it is to be observant of people's behavior and valuable to build a strong relationship with your early backers. I consider Airbnb to be a well designed product because it shifted the way people started to think about strangers and indirectly created a platform to people to experience vacation spots and cities through the eyes of locals. I will never forget my best Airbnb experience when my host in Amsterdam invited my friend and I to her Easter brunch when we asked for suggestions on places to eat. Without hesitation, she begged us to have a traditional Dutch breakfast with her and her boyfriend. I still laugh to think how absurd, yet incredibly lucky I was, to share an intimate and cultural moment with my host.",Directors of our PD program sent announcement to our email list,"I didn't pick question number 2 because I hope my portfolio showcases my experience in graphic design, product design, and design thinking.

Likewise, a graphics class taught me that there is a science behind practical art-- ranging from a singular, beautiful artwork to a sleek, interactive user interface. As an avid violinist, my main goal is to convey my emotion and message to the audience, and I believe this venture is applicable to design: you can fall short if your design fails to create an empathetic experience and if it fails to reach the user’s heart. Through this, I hope to better realize both the implications of the tactile and visual experience of user interfaces and how to create those types of interactive media (ranging from an iPhone app to the immersive virtual reality).

I believe that in order to make a truly successful product and to have the desired impact on an audience or consumer base, one needs to have a solid understanding of both the design and business domains. A large part of this connection between design and business is intelligent ideation and smart branding and leadership to create a successful product. I hope to learn more about these aspects at the Designation conference, and use these skills to design and create products that have a positive impact on people worldwide.","I took a year out of my undergraduate career at Stanford University to pursue an internship at Apple’s iPhone Product Design team in 2015. I was fortunate enough to serve as the Design Lead on iPhone 6S button systems, where I worked to design product architecture and implement manufacturing methods. The experience was intense – I was responsible for cross-functional teams and vendors, and worked to support production startup and large-scale product rollout both in California and on-site at factories in China. Mechanical design and operations were key to the project, but also extremely essential were the design thinking processes and creative problem solving methods I used to find solutions and optimize processes in such a fast-paced environment.

Seemingly a small thing, but other streaming services have previously startled me with their ads that are quite loud. Also, telling the user that a company is sponsoring the ads might make them more willing to listen to them - this has definitely been the case for me.
  In addition, the streaming service is very personal: for example, it suggests you new songs to add to your playlist and curates a weekly playlist for you, which makes you feel cared about. Lastly, Spotify makes it easy to discover new music with their generic playlists: they seem to target a younger audience first and make the experience great for them before branching out to target all music listeners.

Through needfinding, we found something surprising: many students went through the registration process alone, and no one held them accountable to actually voting.
  
  We launched the Stanford Voter Project: a pop-up student group that transformed voting from an individual chore to a community activity. We harnessed Stanford dorm culture by recruiting a Voter Champion in each dorm to be the go-to person for all things voting. These people posted “I am a voter” signs — designed based on social science research about group persuasion — on the doors of registered voters. Our network had 41 Voter Champions in 25 dorms, reaching over 3,000 students.
  
  From using design thinking for iterating, to graphic design for creating thousands of signs, to systems design for managing volunteers, this initiative was a crash course in design methods.","The IKEA furniture experience is well designed. I’m not talking about the furniture itself — I’m talking the self-assembly process that IKEA is known for. 
  
  You may think that forcing users to decipher pictographic instructions, attach pieces of Swedish wood, and puzzle over leftover screws is bad design. But I believe that self-assembly experience is a huge factor in IKEA’s success for three reasons:
  1. Maker Bias: Recent psychology research shows that people prefer things they make themselves over things made by others.
  2. Shared Struggle: Building a complex piece of furniture with a friend is a bonding experience. Finishing it together strengthens a friendship — or at least creates shared memories.
  3. Stories: People love commiserating over the struggles and successes assembly. This is free and powerful marketing for IKEA.

As an mechanical engineer, I also use a lot of 3D modeling software such as Inventor, Solidworks, Rhino, Blender, NX, SketchUp, and more.","My main interest in attending Designation is to network and hear from others with similar interests as me. Attending a design conference, I look forward to learning new techniques and design theories from other artists and designers. I look forward to hearing stories about how others got started and how they got to where they are now today. One of the most memorable experience at a conference was because of an inspiring story I heard from the keynote speaker. He is currently a multi-billionaire but his beginnings were extremely humble. Coming from an immigrant family that lived paycheck to paycheck, I connected deeply with the speaker as he also described his own family’s eviction and homelessness. From that experience, I really look forward to learning more about other people and their stories. I learn so much from every experience and I hope to do the same.","Last year, I had a team project for a competition that required a ping pong ball be transferred from one tower to another tower without the use of hands, motors, or other actuators. Both towers are elevated to a height of six feet off the ground and the towers are placed three apart. Furthermore, no actuators may be used and building materials were limited to only cardboard. For this problem, my team defined the problem at hand and identified the criterion we needed to satisfy the design problem. We brainstormed many different ways of transferring the ball, from having a zip line and cart carry the ball over to having catapaults and canons. Eventually, we realized that the canon approach would yield the biggest wow factor for the audience. The canon approach also required less set up as we built a canon from a toilet paper roll and rubber band into one of the towers. The zipline method would have required a line be established between the two towers which made the design more difficult. By the end of the contest, we pulled off a perfect demonstration as we shot the ball from one tower to the next. A little added flour in the canon provided a nice “gunpowder” effect and made the crowd go crazy. We won first place from that contest! Throughout the whole process, we brainstormed, prototyped, and reiterated heavily and applied design thinking to every part of the build.",,I've been searching for conferences like this!,,3452c035-7311-48e1-8685-e17deb9c3521

At Designation, I look forward to learning new ways of approaching design from both industry professionals and other students, and I hope to use the skills I learn in my professional life when I graduate in the Spring. Additionally, I want to share my takeaways from the conference with other students in the Product Design major at Stanford and with Stanford’s Design for America branch.","Last summer, I was on a three-person team at Steelcase that developed a room reservation device that explored the future of connected devices in the workplace. Our design goal was to make a product that was simple, elegant, and approachable. To keep the functionality simple, we used a technology called Reality Editor to design an augmented digital layer that contained the reservation device’s secondary features. By having a digital layer, we eliminated the need for a screen on the device and were able to focus on designing for the main functionality — being able to reserve a room immediately and to see the status of the room. After material exploration, dozens of sketches, and prototyping, we decided on a circular shape with an inviting slight concavity that was made out of black glass.

I conceptualized the needfinding process of discovering why users might want personalized recommendations on any entertainment content, and analyzed survey data and mobile heatmap analysis to understand user interaction. Later on, I designed the overall color scheme and specific icons to fit the intended value proposition, and also designed the first mobile app that allowed users to write detailed reviews on entertainment content on the go.
  
  The product named Open is a mobile application that provides personalized recommendations on music, movies, and books. From a casual conversation with my friend, we realized that we occasionally find out interesting concerts of an unknown band. While discovering interesting music is pleasing, such discovery comes across accidentally. I thought, if I better knew about my tastes, discovering unknown, yet great music will be much easier!

  To me, a well designed product is a practical product or service that best serves the core value proposition to users in a unique way that previous iterations of other products have not explored. Just by looking at the Varier’s Variable balans chair, you immediately notice that it does not resemble how a regular chair looks. Surely, there are many iterations of how a chair should work and look, and famous designs include Joe Colombo’s “Elda chair,” Francois Azambourg’s “Mr Bugatti Chair,” or Antoni Gaudi’s “Calvet”. Nonetheless, they seem to resemble a regular shape of chairs, but I was immediately captivated by how Varier took a completely different approach in structuring how chairs look. At the same time, Varier aims to be very ergonomic, and help users keep posture upright, while allowing them to tilt motions to best sit on the chair comfortably.",I heard about Designation through a friend at Stanford who suggested me that I'd be a good fit to Designation.,"While I did not address the question about why I am interested in attending Designation, I am very excited to attend Designation, because it is the only conference in the world that provides students opportunities to network with creative designers and executives.
  
  I think humans are irrational in nature, and are prone to make strange, surprising decisions. For example, when given too many choices, people often choose the default option without careful examination of each choice. I believe great social and mobile computing design, along with the Internet, can effectively assist people to make better decisions. For instance, appropriate data analysis and software design can nudge people towards choosing more appropriate 401(k) plans.

I spent two months visiting soup kitchens and shelters throughout the Bay Area to shadow and develop empathy with an incredibly misunderstood user group. We found that they wanted to serve others, rather than be recipients of a system. From this need, we prototyped garden workdays and pop-up restaurants that employed them so that they could feel more empowered. The environments we create also help break down boundaries between peoples: housed and unhoused individuals alike eat and work together in the gardens and kitchens, and participate in discussions surrounding homelessness.

It isn't just some corollary factor that makes products pretty for consumers. It is something that permeates every interaction we have - with our devices, our products, people, companies, and our world. Design is about the details and about the entire experiences we encounter. As a freelance artist and graphic designer, it's no secret that design is what occupies my mind. It's fun, it's dedicated towards improvement and it's awesome.
  
  With this in mind, I am incredibly interested in intermingling with other design-oriented minds. Change comes with diverse collaboration. This is one of the tenets of Design Thinking - a type of thinking that I have sought out study abroad to cultivate.

  oDocs is a New Zealand based social enterprise/R&D startup that creates ophthalmological eye imaging attachments which clip onto iPhones to check for disease and damage of the eye.

Product design at Stanford focuses a lot on UX and the design process, when there's so many more facets of design that I've - quite literally - spent hours agonizing over and dreaming about doing. What I hope to gain the most from this conference is perspective, and the ability to connect with designers across the world.

  It's gorgeous, elegant, practical, useful. It's something you can envision owning in your own home, a better alternative to what is currently out in the ladle market, and it solves the simple problem of not being able to get the last drop. By just replacing the tip of a simple ladle form with soft silicon, Yoon creates a superior product and experience.
  
  The beauty of this design is that Yoon mastered the art of abstraction; something I think a lot of designers struggle with is successfully being able to communicate an idea with as little as possible. By doing so, he tips his hat to elegance and function. The bright colored tip indicates a different material or use, and once the user discovers it is made of a soft silicon rubber, they know instinctively its use. It's brilliant.
  
  What I love about this design in particular is that it makes me excited for what is possible. This clever design reminds me that so much is possible with design, and that the things we accepted as ""the way it is"" is not necessarily how it ought to be. I only hope to be able to channel the same principles in my own work!","My friend texted me in a frantic ""CHECK YOUR EMAIL, THIS IS PERFECT FOR YOU!!!""

To the average user, setting up fingerprint technology can seem daunting. Apple recognizes the functional need to gather multiple fingerprint scans for higher accuracy but also the user need to get this done simply. Thus I am fond of their solution, which employs a single fingerprint icon whose lines fill-in as one continually presses a fingerprint upon the home button. The choice to use a single fingerprint icon rather than switching between screens removes the potential user tedium from endlessly pressing. Moreover during the scanning process, it is instrumental that feedback involves the supportive variety of “Just one more scan!” rather than a berating “Incorrect fingerprint detected! Try again” — while both invoke the same functional result of another scan, the latter can be offputting to a user who is likely simply pressing her finger on a home button and not knowing what is incorrect.",Email from Stanford Women in Computer Science Group,,e3f0de7a-e67f-4e4a-bace-88bbbc3f3962

I am very excited to potentially meet others who are passionate about design as well.","Right now, I'm building a full cross-platform app for Kiron, a non-profit startup whose mission is to empower refugees to continue higher education in their host countries. The first prototype is a student announcement app plus an admin dashboard to manage messages. The admin is able to send messages and filter recipients by location, program type, and other relevant educational categories. Traditional communication management through email is not suited for this problem because of the low connectivity in refugee camps.
  
  When designing the app infrastructure, I chose to use React Native for its cross-platform capabilities, and Firebase for real-time data streaming and powerful offline capabilities. I’ve also had to design a clean notification management interface that still works well with bad connections and lower end phones (which is all that some refugees can afford since they left everything behind).",,An email list from my school,"I'm also interested in decentralized system-level design (an example would be BitChute, the BitTorrent-based alternative to YouTube that doesn't require a central server) http://slides.com/liezlp/deck-7#/",0f4ad53f-ddb1-4dfc-9bba-326519f9af81

We chose a user group of narcoleptics (yes!), and took it all the way from 1) needfinding with users remotely to 2) brainstorming as a team to 3) prototyping multiple concepts in parallel to push for the best solution for our problem. Ultimately, we were searching for ways to allow our users to regain their lost sense of self-efficacy, a common theme from our interviews. We ended up creating an app concept that imagined tracking variables from a narcoleptic's life and looking for trends in happiness and mood.

We stepped through the first three stages of design thinking: empathize, need-find, and ideate. We did 21 interviews at 6 Bay area companies, defined the problems and pushed insights, and then we created a three-step presentation of some of our ideas about how diversity and inclusion might be better.

I was taking a three-week crash course into Design Thinking, and our final project was to implement the 5-step system to solve an issue on campus. In the end, my team decided to prototype a clothes “refreshing” machine that would cut down washing machine use by 50%, thus saving thousands of gallons of water monthly. However, that product idea would’ve never been reached, if it weren’t for the design thinking process serving as our backbone. I would have never thought to design a project with empathy as a launching point—I had always thought that product design inevitably consisted of a trial-and-error game between the producer and the consumer.

After defining the major issues cable providers face in an age dominated by streaming services, we conducted an in-depth cultural analysis of trends and phenomena that can be connected to the various issues consumers consistently reported. One of the defining concepts which we used as a mode of analysis, was recognizing the rise of over-consumption and consumer fatigue that is starting to dominate customer’s consumption levels.

  My experience at Deutsch, coupled with my deep interest and research into the ways mass consumption and advertising have altered the human psyche, make me wonder how corporations and advertisers will cope with the numerous future realities that will emerge from virtual/augmented reality, robots substituting humans, and the emergence of useless being. Almost a century ago, advertisers launched an onslaught on the self, flooding our bodies with millions of images and products. However, while these images have become increasingly closer to our bodies, it is only a matter of time before the developments of virtual/augmented reality will allow these ads to actually enter our bodies, not as a suggestion to consume, but rather as a directive. Soon enough I will put on a VR headset, see an image of myself wearing an Adidas sweater, how a couch will look in my living room, and proceed to purchase without hesitation. Although these changes are already occurring (see link below), the numerous realities that will arise, will take some time to form.

  Terminals on modern operating systems are a relic of the mid-1970s computing environment that brought them about.

  Ancient vs. modern terminals: http://kuuv.io/i/UelUCYt.jpg
  
  Our project retained only the essence of the shell—a command-based interface to existing core system utilities—using visual cues to display progress and results of a user's commands without needing to explicitly query for results (exit status) after the fact.
  
  Because of how history is handled in terminal emulators, outdated information can linger in sight well after conditions have changed. As daily users of terminal emulators, we each hated constantly asking for the same information. Our design provided a visual space where information stayed updated, being re-executed whenever it became stale.","Credit unions are well designed. Though certainly not the sexiest of design challenges, credit unions represent one of the most successful experiments in reimagining an institution for the better. Though banks and credit unions both allow the same basic functions to members (storing and borrowing money), the latter is structured such that each of these functions benefits its membership. Credit union members can also voice their opinions on how the institution should be run.
  
  Their resemblance to for-profit banks is as intentional as it is misleading; because of their surface resemblance from the perspective of the average user, transitioning from a bank to a credit union is seamless. This has allowed the radical democratic mutualism that credit unions represent to creep into ubiquity in the financial sector, to the point that branches of multinational for-profit banks find themselves competing with tiny, local, self-governing credit unions.

Appropriately, I thought, I chose my major to be International Studies. Soon after, my major changed to public affairs with a concentration on nonprofits. Finally, I settled on computer science with a focus in design (though I kept a minor in nonprofits). Out of all the disciplines I’ve studied, none has come as close to my original goal as design has. I think the ability to solve difficult problems creatively and collaboratively, and to find accessible and innovative solutions is essential to bettering our world. 
  
  This Designation conference is my chance to meet and be inspired by mentors and peers who will help me use computer science to harness the age of information to connect people and make them happy.","From October 2014 to October 2016 I served as the chair to the national board of an international peace-education organization. Our organizational structure had just changed a year prior. This National Junior Board of Trustees was newly created and struggling to find its role in the organization. After learning about design thinking, I designed a weekend seminar for the members of the board. In preparation for the weekend, the members of the board and I conducted interviews with stakeholders all around the world and used what we learned to construct personas. We worked to develop a problem statement for the organization and brainstormed to find a creative solution.

This event obviously represents the very same mentality, so I love the idea of learning from and connecting with those that have found new and different ways to design for the world. I hope to take what I learn and incorporate it in my life outside of college–my job, my personal projects, and my personal philosophies.","When I worked with my sister on her business’s logo, I was presented with an interesting communicative situation. Initially, she could only describe the emotions she experiences when walking through forests to describe her ideal logo. It was the broadest logo description anyone had ever given me–nonetheless, I had to find a way to take her abstract feelings and form them into a sleek and professional logo design. We went through multiple stages of me attempting to capture an “organic essence” while also making it appear “classic” (a few of many words used throughout the process). I was eventually able to depict exactly what she felt at the very beginning, and even ended up incorporating an element she said she would have never thought to include, but one that she loved.

I later learned through my experience with entrepreneurship that no one will buy something that they don’t need and so before a product is made, an entrepreneur must find out the needs of the person who’s going to be using it. Because of my interest in this type of thinking, I decided to take a course on design thinking in order to improve my skills in creating products that people will want and use. I hope by attending Designation that I can exchange ideas with a diverse group of other like minded people on how to think critically about design. I believe that with each person’s unique life experiences, I will be able to learn a new tidbit or tip from everyone I meet. My goal is to take these skills and be able to apply them to my career as a software engineer in designing applications that people will enjoy. Being able to create easier to use applications will increase productivity amongst co-workers and increase satisfaction with customers. As our society converges towards products with more focus on user centered design, these skills will be crucial to any products released.","During a Student Entrepreneurship Fellowship program, I designed a system of creating a radio ratings system that tracks user listening activity through a smartphone. The current system of tracking user activity used pagers and was outdated. Because of this outdated system, the user demographics reported per station was inaccurate and created a possibility that advertisers lose money due to advertisements being targeted at the wrong demographic. My research consisted of understanding the needs of both advertisers, stores that put out radio advertisements, and radio stations themselves. For advertisers, I cold called and got interviews with associates from GSD&M, McGarrah Jessee, Sanders/Wingo and more. I found out that they had problems with radio stations over/underpricing ad slots based on inaccurate reports of target demographic. Thus, I decided to talk to some radio stations. Again, through cold calling, I was able to talk to a VP at iHeartRadio, Former COO of Clear Channel, and more. The information I received from radio stations also validated the need to create a more accurate radio ratings system and thus the system of tracking user listening activity through a smartphone was born. This system allowed me to increase the user base, thereby increasing statistical significance of the ratings, while simultaneously lowering the cost.",,Hackathon Hackers FB page,,326e7402-bc02-47da-8f35-f68c9f0623d1

In solving the problem, we concluded that we would foster the next generation of designers through a three-pillar, incremental design program for 3 different skill proficiencies: beginner, amateur, and advance.

It involved interviewing over 15 different users, mentors and experts on Dementia and countless hours of research all within the 30 hour hackathon. I started out by defining the problem that we wanted to solve. We wanted to help researchers collect data on patients and we were interested in incorporating Amazon Alexa into our solution. While defining our problem I realized that the success of collecting data heavily depended on the dementia patient’s usage of Amazon Echo. This led to a new iteration that focused on understanding what would motivate a dementia patient to use Amazon Echo in their home. Further research led to results which showed that several early stage dementia patients were already using Amazon Echo and that it was popular product among elderly people. Research into the motivation of dementia patients and understanding our target market took up a large portion of this particular design thinking exercise but the findings proved to be invaluable. After collecting vast amounts of user research and feedback, I took these findings and created wireframes and mock-ups which then led to new questions that required further research. This process was repeated many times throughout the hackathon and eventually I was able to put all the pieces together. I collaborated with my team members to bring this idea to life and lead the combination of design thinking, product design, and engineering of the product to ultimately distill our solution to its simplest form.",,Through the HH Design group on Facebook and a friend who suggested I apply for this.,Super excited about this conference.

  Unlike my previous design projects, my contribution had little to do with aesthetic and even the UX. It instead was almost purely user interaction based. As the only engineer on the project, I had to bring to life what our designers had in mind with code. This made me really appreciate the little things, as I had to focus on what technical aspects of the front-end could make a user experience as smooth and intuitive as possible. Plus, we took our prototypes to the UX research room and brought in live testers to get immediate feedback and results.

Costs, complications, and inconvenience skyrocket: modern medicine should be able to solve this mechanical problem, I thought. After a year of thinking, and another of prototyping, I designed a spinal implant which automatically lengthens along with the growth of a child, and a novel system to test spinal implants which took me from high school to the International Science and Engineering fair to the White House - all by design. I look forward to learning and thinking together about other ways design can upend health care.","I was recently hired as a volunteer - at the Hospital for Special Surgery, the #1 orthopedic hospital in America - helping to run the family atrium, patient visits, and doctor-patient coordination on the day of surgery. In my first experience in this sector of the health care (already experienced with research, academics, community public health organizing, and patient care) I have been blown away by their framing of medical care as “Helping the World Get Back in the Game of Life.” By positioning themselves as each patient’s “team” rather than an overwhelming hospital bureaucracy, along with the positive and forward thinking goal of life as a game, they achieve the unthinkable – making surgery sound not just tolerable, but enticing.

While the idea of the app is exciting, I believed the user interface should also convey the excitement and ""dare"". Responsible for the entire UI, I designed backgrounds and user profiles with colors that invite people to loosen up and try new things, and features such as upvote/downvote, ""dare"" buttons/messages, etc. to enhance the mood of the app. The integrated final product was a success, and from this experience I fell in love with full-stack development and prototyping from scratch both functionalities and user interfaces.",,A friend :),,a182b56a-362a-4bfe-93f7-1dd331847a6d

I struggled through my first three years of college, not really sure what I wanted to do. I knew I was passionate about both my majors, and I knew I didn't want to be a software engineer. I explored Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, but I quickly learned that I didn't want to be stuck behind a computer writing lines and lines of code each day. I took a ""User Interface"" class that taught me design thinking and how to design for beautiful UI and UX. From then on, I was hooked.

However, the User Interface course I took was basically the only class on campus that involved design thinking. It was hard to find time to do my own HCI work on top of all my coding coursework.

  I helped create this application from the ground up. From the initial ""Health Care"" theme, we used design thinking methodologies to decide on what possible apps we could build, and slowly narrowed it down. Once we decided on a mood tracker app, there were so many aspects to consider, such as the number of moods we would present to the user for them to select, what moods they would be, what colors we would use to represent them, etc. I interviewed individuals with depression and anxiety to figure out what they would like to see in a mood-tracking app. In addition, I conducted research on what doctors normally ask their depression patients so we could provide an accurate measure of moods in our app. I also researched colors and what colors should represent what moods. 
  
  Overall, we wanted a smooth and efficient UX. Especially with the smartwatch, it was a realm of technology I had never designed for before. We had to design for the small screen size and reduce the number of steps needed for users to interact with our app. For example, once the user selects a mood, they select an intensity from a scale. We decided on a 1-5 scale, rather than 1-10, since 5 data points would be simpler to choose from yet informative enough, and we defaulted it to ""3"" so the user could select their intensity as fast as possible. (At most two more clicks to get to 1 or 5.) Overall, I designed with the user in mind.

  In my final year project next semester, I will be researching on how design can benefit engineers to see things more holistically and better their problem solving skills, and eventually help me achieve my vision. Attending this conference would allow me to solidify and broaden my perspectives on the importance of design and definitely help me in my vision of bringing design to education systems all over the world.","I started a club back in my sophomore year to help engineers learn design, believing that this knowledge would help them better solve problems. It was created as I felt that the lack of emphasis on design in the engineering curriculum was a problem, and I strongly believe that design is an integral skill that should be taught.
  
  The beginners were given lessons on graphic design principles while the advanced members took on client jobs. Although this club revolved around graphic design projects, the start and growth of this club also involved a lot of design thinking. I tried to empathise with club and committee members through observations and feedback, so as to better the way we teach. Although the structure and lessons of the club is far from perfect, it's through uncovering more problems that we improve, which essentially is the essence of design thinking.",,Through a facebook design group in my school,,9a6a39ce-431d-413e-a2a6-fa4a73158ee8

We followed this process from beginning to end, doing research on other types of products that had attempted this model, and also interviewing parents and children on their experiences with brushing and also the kinds of things that engage the interest of children.

There are no reminders that you are drawing from funds when you send money to a friend, and you are very rarely prompted to clarify credit card information so the user becomes comfortable with moving money in a fluid manner. On top of that they have a built-in fund where money sent to you is stored, so that users can form a conceptual model of not actually moving money from their own accounts, but simply dealing in money that they have stored up in the actual service.",My Human-Centered Design club Berkeley Innovation had high praise of it and encouraged us all to try and take part.,"I appreciate the effort that it takes to organize an event like this, and I'm glad that there are people actively trying to promote the importance of design thinking in the modern day.

After conducting interviews with individuals who had experienced spinal chord injuries, we identified the folks do not receive reliable feedback as to whether they are making progress by performing exercises, or whether other muscles are compensating for the weakened muscle, which is frustrating and discouraging. Loss of function in the hands and arms are considered the most debilitating and hard to deal with, so we chose to focus on these areas.
  With the design considerations from our interviews, we conceptualized and prototyped an LED bracelet with electromyography sensors which could be placed directly on a muscle. Using an Arduino, live feedback in the form of changing LED color would indicate muscle activity levels. We iterated through bracelet designs and chose a snap fit because it would be easy to apply for persons with limited hand function.

After researching different types of subjective text (blog posts, chats, etc.) we discovered ratings for reviews were very different from website to website and were often ambiguous; people could value the same “five stars” very differently. Thus we developed an app-prototype, Ezi, which uses sentiment analysis of employee reviews to improve the accuracy of current job search algorithms and create an objective standard.

The initial intrigue and focus in aesthetic, 2. Realising that it is more and brilliantly encompasses functionality, 3, And then taking a step back and thinking about the contexts and communities that design can contribute to. 
  
  I want to focus on number 3. Here, especially in the bay area, the idea of design is saturated and seemingly limited to UIUX and tech. I want to better understand the role of design in more diverse, and perhaps impending contexts - How can we contribute to politics / social good with design? Which communities need it more than others? As we become more exposed to the world around us, it becomes more impending to grasp these seemingly complex concepts in a more relatable, accessible manner, to allow everyone to be sufficiently well informed. 
  
  As such, I believe the opportunity to attend a 3-day conference centred around design and related issues would be a great platform for me to achieve this.","In Spring 2016, I was on a project team consulting for Indiegogo (a crowdfunding platform) where we got to work directly with their VP of design. Our task was to redesign the under-utilised profile page of campaigners/entrepreneurs to drive lifetime value as they roll out more projects on the platform. 
  
  Our process was divided up into these sprints: 
  1. User research sprint - where we interviewed product-based campaigners and users. We discovered that users feel that the current platform provides insufficient metrics for reliability of a project, while campaigners felt lack of customisation to communicate their brand. There was also a huge problem in accessibility of the page (too many clicks). 
  
  2. Ideation - We ideated four versions of profile pages, each focused on a theme from a different problem from our user research phase: Activity, Reliability, Personalization and Marketplace. So, for example, the profile page focused on reliability will have more statistics that communicate the success of a product. 
  
  3. User Testing - We deployed our mid-fi prototypes on InVision and used UserTesting.com to conduct focused group user testing. 
  
  4. Consolidation - We found that the following pairs of themes naturally converged: (Activity + Reliability) - Focused building trust between the user and campaigner, and (Personalisation + Marketplace) - Focused on establishing the campaigners' product and brand. 
  
  You can read more about this project here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/42146605/Indiegogo-Entrepreneur-Profile","I thought it'll be interesting to highlight a non-product/UIUX example: The City of Medellin in Colombia - 25 years ago, in the 1980s, it was the most dangerous city in the world, attributing to drug wars centred around the infamous Pablo Escobar. A city on the brink of collapse, it underwent extraordinary revival - And it did so using really innovative, novel methods.
  
  Cities are meant for its people. Most of its population lived in the mountains surrounding the city in ""communas"" or slums, as they were too poor. Instead of limiting the city exclusively to the rich and tourists (which many places around the world inevitably do), the government took the extra step to connect and integrate the poorer communities with these two solutions:
  
  1. Cable cars as a mode of affordable public transportation. Given it's unique geographical layout, if you lived up in the mountains, it will be a dangerous and long (1-2 hours) commute down to the city. This implementation not only allowed the poorer communities to commute safely and efficiently (15-25 mins) to the city, but also proved as an innovative solution to attract fascinated tourists, improving the tourism economy. It truly connected the people to the city centre. 
  
  2. Library parks in poorer communas to bridge the gap in education between the well-to-do and the poor. The idea of a well constructed, furnished library tends to be associated with important districts or universities, which the poor don't have as much access to. Not only do these library parks serve to educate, they are also beautifully designed spaces that communities can dwell at. 
  
  I feel that this is an example of truly beautiful design - Innovative (cable cars as a mode of public transport?!) and highly impactful (a whole city and more!)",From a friend who has a friend at Princeton.,Really excited for this! :),43c8610e-c971-4280-a4ba-3c7c1d3c0e55

I then sorted them out and condensed them into key features to be included in the app (for eg a map showing study sessions around the user, friend contact list etc). Further iterations together with user testing were then done to make sure the flow of the experience was smooth, that accessing certain features of the app were intuitive.

The little nuances found in and around the bag really makes a huge difference to the user. Peak design has thoroughly thought out the pain points of common bags. For instance, accessing the contents of a regular backpack requires unslinging the bag and bringing it fully over to the front before we can access the zipper. Peak design bags however open from the side, so we can access the inside of the bag very efficiently. The bag also has unique separators that help compartmentalize the bag. This is super useful for photographers who want to sort out their gear clearly as well as protect their gear from bumping into other things in the bag. They did not only make this feature available, they made it so well that we could easily customize the separators to whichever needs we have. Also, side slots and pockets allow attachment of drones and tripods, which can be secured with straps. Straps are usually a setback for common bags as they hand loose and cause a lot of chaos. Peak design was able to handle this issue properly even though their bags have more straps than most. When not in use, they usually hide very easily into small slots and holes, giving the bag a very clean look even though there are many things happening on the bag.",Through a friend,nope,d405afe1-53e7-4b34-95bd-ef8c27241b3d

I want to be a designer because I believe in the utilitarian function of design; and how it can transform education and governments. Attending Designation would help me gain knowledge and insight to become a mover and shaker in the design world. Being at Designation would give me the rare opportunity to learn all the functions of being a design leader that I otherwise would not be exposed to. The conference offers and opportunity for me to learn and grow as a designer to become an even better one. As a soon-to-be graduate, the hands-on workshops and intimate discussions with industry leaders will prove beneficial to my career goals. If I do get the opportunity to attend Designation, I hope to share what I’ve learned with the design community at my school, which I am heavily involved in. Additionally, I hope to apply these skills to a career in product design at a tech for good company.","For a multidisciplinary class, I prototyped an app which addresses an existing problem within the healthcare system.

  MediWait addresses two key pain points of the current waiting room experience, which stem from a lack of two-way communication and transparency between hospitals and their patients. There is inefficient communication of patient medical information, and a lack of waiting time updates on the side of the hospital. Together, these issues disrupt what could be a seamless medical visit.
  
  We have two target users: working professionals, and hospital administrators. These are people with families and careers that take up much of their time, leading to packed schedules that must be carefully managed. That’s where MediWait comes in, providing users with frequently updated wait times for urgent care waiting rooms in the area. Patients can make informed decisions about where to go in order to still stay on schedule. Using faces identifying emotion, the user can rate their discomfort level. Users can finally add any other concerns he would like the medical staff in the waiting room, or the doctor or nurse he meets with, to know in advance. Before the user even gets there, they’ll have been sent his or her insurance information, medical history records, and current symptoms. Once the user arrives, they will be greeted by name, and will have done most of their “waiting” on the way over. This project can also be found on my website: www.caitbahari.com under Mediwait",,From the HHDesign FB group,,11255174-0aa8-45d9-b080-d13c8bd5f6c8

Everything was about human centered design, and made by users who understand the hassle of sorting pills and for pill takers who struggle with the same need. Everything from the setup to the way each pill information is inputted into the app via OCR of medication labels to tracking medication compliance is on par with the needs of the users we are targeting.

To me, design thinking is the ability for a designer to take what they know and implement their creative strategies through the genesis of a design but also adapt their skills that executes a final concept that adheres to a brand. Through this process I learned a lot about communication and problem solving.

It really surprised me when instead of diving into the typical sort of documental research that comes with architecture school, we started creating persona stories of the kinds of people who live in this floating slum in Muara Baru, Indonesia. We were given interview documents and complete freedom in redesigning a slum system that really just WORKED for the residents and did not try to demean or discourage their way of living. My team and I designed a sort of modular system of tent shaped houses made entirely out of found local bamboo that allowed for a reduction in health risks from poluted waters and expansion and deconstruction according to needs. What I learnt from the end of this project was that design thinking really was a way of encouraging empathy. When you design for people, you are designing for PEOPLE. Individual, unique, specific people who often don't know what they want to change but know that something has to change.","Clue is a menstrual cycle tracking app that I've used since freshman year of high school. While there are many out there and everyone I know seems to use a different selection, I've stuck to this particular one because of it's usability and simplicity. When you first open the app, you are taken to a home page with an arrow that spans the entirety of a circle circumference. Your current cycle day is represented by a green bubble that circulates around this arrow and allows you to see the different phases that your body is going through. When you enter into the data page you are given selections according to how heavy your flow is on that particular day, your current mood, your temperature, any pain, amounts of sleep. What this forces me to do is to track the effects and changes that my lifestyle has on my cycle. More than just a cycle tracking app, it's colors are clean, calendar is simple to use and it has potential as a wider health tracking application for women.",I was forwarded an email that was sent to my organization Berkeley Innovation from representatives of the event.,"There are so many facets of design such as there is no such thing as a one-dimensional designer.

People told us stories about how they had missed their stop when too engrossed in an activity, like reading or listening to music, or when they relied on external visual cues and couldn't see them anymore when it was stormy or dark outside. We came up with several redesigns, ranging from practical to futuristic. The simplest redesign involved having the speaker announce the next stop after the one it was currently approaching, so that people would have several chances to hear their stop. Another was to have a screen with a map featuring landmarks so that people could track their progress and know which stop corresponded with the supermarket (as an example of a landmark).

We began by conducting research about our user's morning routines through contextual inquiries, guerilla interviews, and secondary research. We developed customer personas and gathered insights using affinity mapping to find that consumers valued health, quality, and taste and often skipped breakfast due to a lack of time and convenience. When conducting usability tests on the current BBox web app, most interviewees thought that the UI structure was simple, but most wanted more visuals in the ordering process. Focusing on the insights that we gathered from research, we began ideation on the overall wall interface and the mobile application for ordering. For the physical component of the project, we created a 8'x10' cardboard low-fidelity prototype before building a refined prototype out of plywood and acrylic to further explore how users would interact with the cubby system.

My team of four classmates worked together with architecture students from Jakarta, Indonesia to address the pressing issue of seasonal flooding in the slums of Muara Baru. During our planning stages, we conducted interviews with Jakarta inhabitants, researched extensively on various agents affecting slums, and created personas of multiple Indonesian slum-dwellers for whom our solution would be designed. Our prototype and solution were models of floating architectural structures inspired by the Makoko Floating School; these modular structures would function both as a community center and a temporary disaster relief area in times of crises. By drawing insights from the local inhabitants of slums, my team proposed this architectural solution to alleviate the community's flooding stress and also the issues that they face everyday: dire struggles with space, sanitation, equity, and education.

Making some assumptions, Spotify Premium's (as the free version has some differences in experience) product goals are most likely to build a product that is not only an intuitive music streaming interface, but also a platform for seamlessly integrating personalization, discoverability, and curation. When you first jump into the mobile app, you land on the ""Home"" tab. It clearly utilizes branding, in the form of copy and strikingly colored visuals with strong imagery that appeals to younger folk and current design trends, in the form of modules: new and topical (Lorde's new album/Oscars hits), ""Just for You"" (pushing personalization and curation), ""Jump Back In"" (your history), and a variety of other modules centering around ""you"", using branded copy to create trust in the product for the user by emphasizing ""you"" to show that Spotify cares about its users. From a usability perspective, each module is organized into square album covers in a carousel display, a perfectly intuitive interaction that is not only native to iOS, but also a very common pattern for album cover display. Moreover, the bold text and images make it easy for users (especially those on the go and driving) to quickly find playlists they're looking for with large tap targets. The music player interface is sticky throughout the product, living in a tab bar right above the bottom tab menu, easily accessible from any part of the app, streamlining the user's access to the main goal of using Spotify-- to play music. Separately, throughout the product there are indications of seamless integration of curation and personalization, from special playlists integrated into the regular playlist flow (Discovery Weekly, Release Radar, etc), to the reusing of existing patterns in the product to introduce concepts like dynamic time sensitive sections (""Sleep Tight"", ""Late Night Focus"") in module form.",Email from organizers to Berkeley Innovation,"Thanks to all of you for organizing this kind of event, it sounds super cool!",1ffcd78e-9ae1-481c-8287-3510646ba185

In my effort to build upon students’ intrinsic motivation to discover what they truly want to become, I worked with students in small group settings and collaborated with mentors so that they can leverage their strengths. We combined the students’ shared interests in sports and interactive games with unique aspects of American culture to create lesson plans. My strong work ethic, persistence, and adaptability paid off. The students’ transition from being nonchalant about future aspirations to taking initiatives to start their own clubs reaffirmed my passion for working with children and the success of my student-centered teaching style.

I believe holistic design involves empathetic design, UX design, and graphic design because we are designing for people. Designation’s 2017 mission of targeting graphic design, product design and design thinking lens aligns with my goals of applying human-centered design with UX design to create user-needed solutions to solve the world’s problems. I hope the combination of the skills I will learn in Designation, my backgrounds in Human-Computer Interaction, sociology, and business will prepare me to be a pioneer in new design spaces.","Baker's Elementary School, located in Southeast County of San Diego, CA, is implementing an 5-year experimental program where a part-time teacher instructs every grade twice a month about a specific S.T.E.M. class that changes every year. Five peers and I took a human-centered design approach to improve the learning within this classroom. I served as team lead for the group. While meeting the students weekly, we identified a need within the classroom, ideated solutions with the students, and on our own, prototyped our solutions. Finally, we conducted user-testing with the students and the teacher.
  
  With two weeks left in our project, we hit a hurdle: our design wasn't solving the needs of the students and the teacher effectively. After reiterating the process again, our final product became a simpler solution that promoted desirability, feasibility, and sustainability for the students and the teacher for the next 5 years.",,"A peer from Design at UCSD, a campus design organization, shared the application with me","I had a difficult time choosing which design project to share in this application because I feel I impacted the lives of the students in the human-centered design project, but I want to showcase the other design principles I follow. I believe human-centered design is how we will create change, but I think it is also necessary to understand User Experience (UX) and graphic design. One of those projects I was involved with was tackling the problem of creating an ideal music streaming app based off of popular platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and Youtube. Over the course of a month, our team would create a working prototype of two user scenarios. Through interviewing and a competitive analysis, we were able to understand the workflow of these four apps. I have the UX and graphic design skills with the human-centered design lens to tackle any design problem.",8ad587a6-8727-4003-a4e7-282fc89a885c

The app aims to make stock trading accessible to everyone, in two main ways. First, Robinhood takes away the financial barrier to entry.

If you have ever used eTrade, you know it’s a terrifying platform. The screen is cramped with information, graphs and statistics, too complex and dense for users to decipher comfortably. Robinhood’s experience is the opposite. It’s simple and clean, designed to fit on the small screen of a smartphone from beginning to end. The onboarding process is shockingly simple and only takes 5 minutes. In that time, Robinhood guides you through the process of submitting important documents and personal information.

When I am writing code, planning how to write it on coffeeshop napkins is as important as implementing functions and following syntax.

  The same is true for someone selling a house, designing an accessible plan for presentation, a social scientist designing a study, a novelist writing a story, or an economist predicting market trends. The ability to design an effective model or method towards one's goal is what separates successful professionals from struggling ones.

  I even wrote to our Orientation Aids and asked to come a few days early to measure closets, under the bed, etc. Four trips to target, two to the container store, hours on amazon.com, and I had a full sketch of how I could store all of my clothes, neatly, in a room the size of my closet. In the end I had my bed lofted several feet, a step stool (with storage within) to help me climb up to it, a shoe rack in my closet, 15 drawers under my bed, and no room to spare, although plenty of storage space for the piles of free T-Shirts I was about to be given.",,"It was posted in our UChicago class of 2020 group, I saw it this morning, and the more I read the more I had to apply, even though today was the last day for applications, and I feel blessed just to have seen it now.","Design extends from children building with wooden blocks, to college students trying to fit 25 sweaters into a closet.

Upon project fulfillment, the impact augments individual income streams (in this case, higher crop yields) that pay back the initial loan to users after a predetermined period.

As News Editor for my school newspaper, the assumption was that I could write well and edit better, but simply excelling in the editorial side of journalism wasn’t enough for the designer inside me.

By standardizing the fonts of each different source into a minimal but slightly out of the ordinary serif, the reading experience changes. New York Times articles are no longer aggressive and blog posts gain a sophistication that often cannot be achieved.

I'm engaged frequently by the product (as is to be expected as the creator); analytics tell me that there's other people who consistently use it like I do.

Although the cost issue with the glasses themselves was solved, the children still lacked accessibility to proper identify the prescription which they required. We used ""How Might We's"" to focus on what areas we need to solve (cost, accessibly technologies, etc). Once we had the idea, we built the prototype (four, in fact), got away from the desk, and conducted user research to determine the best form of examination.

The main project was to redesign a municipal case-reporting app for the Singapore government and I collaborated with a team of students to create wireframes and high fidelity prototypes from generated user requirements. Talking to a wide range of end-product users made me realize what an impact an effective user experience can bring and how many current products are not inclusive enough for the diverse society we live in. While it may not have been the most impressive project, it solidified my desire to pursue a more design-oriented career path and helped me gain confidence in my ability to learn, allowing the difference in skills between myself and others inspire me, instead of discourage me.",,Through a friend,,9630faeb-be0c-4933-82ba-93fb96941215

As a graduating senior, I have limited time left to make an impact our members' lives and hopefully spark their creative flames.","One of my personal projects within Design for America is tackling the issue of children and technology and how moderation is key. Our problem statement is ""How can we limit technology usage in children within households to become beneficial to familial ties?"" From this angle, we want to teach kids at a young age that always being on technology is not good as it hinders creative growth. Therefore we utilized the design process to identify possible solutions such as lock boxes, reading services, and applications. However, after partnering with the local YMCA and local elementary schools, we decided that a children's book would be the best route as it engages the parents to read to their children and subtly teaches them that moderation is key when it comes to balancing technology and family time.",,Our national Design for America network forwarded our studio this information.,,21a9e2ca-17cf-41d0-8439-5baf00712abe

A traditional keyboard has a total of 104 keys which is almost twice as many as the 60 keys on the HHKB Pro 2. The HHKB moves all of the keys that have been removed onto a secondary function layer so no functionality is sacrificed. The most interesting design choice on the keyboard is moving the Caps Lock key to the function layer and replacing it with the left CTRL key. On a traditional keyboard, the Caps Lock key is seldom pressed multiple times in succession, but it is in an easily accessible location. So moving the CTRL key to the location of Caps Lock reduces strain on the pinky especially for power users who constantly use CTRL options on their keyboards.",A friend recommended it to me via Facebook,,a84a66c7-357e-4346-81d8-960145c3834d

Though their site is not aesthetically pleasing, their UX is seamless. The typical consumer does not think about how easy it is for them to find an item, to filter out by ratings or shipping costs, to find recommended or related products to those they are searching for, to check out and subsequently track their packages. The consumer journey is almost invisible, as good design should be, and never makes you think twice.

I was tasked to rebrand the hackathon in a way that would attract more hackers (more than 250 hackers). This was my first big project and it was exciting yet scary at first. I had no experience with designing something that had significant impact on a whole community. Yes, this was scary, but exciting as well. So, before I actually started to mockup some visual ideas for the rebrand, my intuition was to reach out to the people we would be impacting: The hackers. I asked them questions such as ""What was your favorite hackathon?"", ""What was one thing you really enjoyed and one thing you would change about that hackathon?"". Through this research, I found that hackers love to feel techy, unique events, and good food. After analyzing the research data, I was having trouble with capturing these positive aspects the hackers had, in a visual form. After many conversations with other hackathon organzers and designers, I realized that design extends outside of what people see. Design is about the overall experience. So, working with our wonderful organizing team, we created a whole new hackathon experience that attracted over 400 hackers. What really hit me dear to my heart was at the end of our hackathon, a group of hackers came up to us (the organizing team) and complimented our efforts with the hackathon. I learned two big things from this, outside of what was said above. The first thing I learned was how important team work and communication are. These help with breaking up tasks so people don't burn out, as well as keeping everyone in the loop so people can give and get help when needed. The second thing I learned was to not be afraid to ask for help. If I never asked other hackathon organizers and designers for assistance, I would still have the mindset that design can only be experienced by seeing.",,HH Design Facebook Group,I love what you all are doing with this Conference.

Through college, I have been more and more interested in entrepreneurship through an honors program on campus and self-research. It has been a big factor in determining the type of industry I want to work in after I graduate. In the end, I wish to design solutions for people to improve their everyday lives, such as biosensors or biomedical devices. To design these solutions, I require better design thinking, teamwork, and communication skills, which I believe Designation will provide.","A project I worked on with my honors program was developing an idealized biosensor capable of measuring multiple parameters that provide key insight into potential risks for cardiovascular diseases. The problem my team wanted to address was saving lives through providing individuals a comprehensive view of their heart health. We thought cardiovascular disease was particularly difficult to diagnose due to different factors that manifest slowly. As a result, treatment is often reactive than active and is administered too late. Additionally, we aspired to empower those same individuals to take a more active role in their heart health on a day-to-day basis using the data acquired from our device. We looked into current solutions, such as blood tests and arm cuff devices, that address this problem and decided to design a new device. After research and interviews, we decided that a biochip was the optimal solution that allowed the user to constantly monitor their heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, and cholesterol levels while being minimally invasive. Unfortunately, this device could not be tested since extensive funds and research would have to be provided to build the product. However, we estimated the costs and materials of the product to provide a rough guess of how much it would take to build it.",,Through my honors program (QUEST) and a friend (Elton Tian),Thanks for spending the time to read this application!,5b6fa208-2f1b-47ff-8ec0-075bd13477c8

Out of the three schools of design, I am most familiar with design thinking. In my Fall 2014 BSE course, BMGT289B “How Do Innovators Think?, ” I read Tom Kelley’s Creative Confidence and discovered design thinking. One of the principles of design thinking instilled in me is: “Some people are more blocked than others, everyone is creative.” I have learned to simply brainstorm ideas without judging them immediately. This spring, I am learning how to coach design thinking in different academic environments across campus. Designation is the ideal opportunity for me to learn about graphic and product design. Through the seminars and workshops, I look forward to developing my visual design skills through the seminars and workshops.","A project of mine that has involved design thinking is creating the final exam for students in the QUEST Honors program at University of Maryland. I innovated one of my favorite college courses, BMGT190: Introduction to Design and Quality, through the Innovo Scholars program at the Smith School. My deliverable was creating and implementing the final exam in December. Unlike the final exams of the past, the format of this assessment was an in-person simulation rather than questions on paper. The final simulation was not the same as my original idea. Empathizing and exchanging feedback with the professor and former students of the course played a major role in this human-centered project. From this experience, I embraced that iteration is the key to success. I wish to design education courses where students are challenged to think critically and incentivized to engage.",,peer in QUEST Honors Program,,70daf32d-bbd4-4beb-84bc-0d26ae581423

I wanted to find an effective and simple way for you to remember someone you met, whether at a career fair or on the first day of class. After many iterations and crazy ideas, I thought of the application “Peep.” To use the application, you would program key phrases you might say after an introduction such as, “It is nice to meet you ___.” Your phone would pick up on the phrase and start up the application saying, “Did you just meet ___.” You will be prompted to enter details on the individual afterwards. Now, you will never forget somebody’s name again.","During my last backpacking trip to Thailand, I discovered the Osprey backpack. In a hot climate I assumed having a 60L backpack behind me would be miserable, but I was wrong. First, it has a mesh backing that keeps a pocket of air between you and the backpack, allowing for breathability. The waist straps sit perfectly on your hipbones, allocating the right amount of weight there and on your shoulders. The straps also include a small “fanny pack” type of pocket good for storing things such as your passport, money, keys, etc. The top of the backpack is detachable for convenient day usage. The backpack also includes a separate bottom compartment that would fit shoes or dirty clothes. Every single strap is placed strategically, whether to fold up the backpack or carry extra supplies. Overall, the Osprey backpack is extremely well designed to meet the needs of any traveler.","On a Facebook group associated with the QUEST Honors Program at the University of Maryland, College Park","At the University of Maryland, I am a part of an organization called the Quality Enhancement Systems and Teams (QUEST) Honors Program.

Over the past year I have been immersed in design thinking. I am passionate about applying my ability to empathize, critically, and creatively think, through the tool of design, to create change in this world. Through my honors program I have found an outlet for this passion, working on multidisciplinary design projects, taking a stab at creating something new.
  Yet, the most exciting part has been the people. Minds who are focused on taking action to create a better future, be that through an innovative product, app, or service. I want to attend Designation to continue this growth, to invest in myself, and to come away with a few new tools and a whole lot of new inspiration to work on projects that excite me.","My first exposure to applying the design thinking process was a through a project in which my team and I created an interactive game to help teach children about what those with certain food allergies can and cannot eat. We knew we wanted to do something to help those with allergies, having been inspired by a near death allergic reaction that my own brother had. Through multiple brain storming sessions, we came to the idea of a game. Along with this process of ideation came the chance to empathize with and understand our target demographic which found us talking to school teachers just as much as playing with toddlers. We prototyped, reiterated, and analyzed our market until we had a prototype for a product that we were truly proud of and believed could better the lives of children all over the county.",,I heard about Designation through a post in the Facebook page for the QUEST Honors Program at UMD.,"I hope you will consider my application for a spot at Designation. Although I may have less experience in design projects than some other applicants, I believe I have the passion, drive, curiosity, and love for learning to more than make up for that. Design is a field that can be difficult to get a foot into, as I have found reaching out to numerous design professionals and companies. However, I know that it is the field I will, sooner, rather than later, find myself extremely happy to be working in. I would be extremely grateful for the chance to take another step down that path with Designation, for the chance to meet others with my passion, learn, and talk about ideas, because if I have learned one thing, it's that that is where the magic happens.

  social interactions. Our group decided to create a social photos application that emphasizes intimate sharing. Our focus on designing
  to lower these sharing barriers as readily as possible drove numerous feature decisions. One such
  feature was to launch directly into the camera on launch, so that users would not have to import photos later. Another
  feature was to auto-upload photos automatically to a shared group, such that the ""photo curation"" stage happened
  after photos were uploaded and shared. This is becaue we felt that users often spent too much time deciding which photos were of sharable
  quality before sharing, and often gave up prematurely. In addition, groups were created not by direct invitaton through Facebook
  or phone numbers, but each group was allowed a user-chosen short string. This custom key acted as a code, creating a less
  robotic and more intimate group joining experience.","I think Quora is a well designed product and brand. As a product, I believe that design is what continues to concentrate
  high quality content on Quora, as compared to competing services. Whereas websites such as Answers.com and Yahoo Answers
  initially only allowed users to follow topics, Quora launched with the ability to follow people - this allowed users to 
  consistently view answers by quality contributors, and vote their answers to the top. The design of this system 
  would also incentivize contributors to continuously create informative posts. In addition, it's inclusion of the author's 
  real name, photo, and tagline alongside every answer augments the credibility of a post. Moreover, Quora's prominent 
  display of authors and answers helps in creating personalities and sticky communities, which further helps to create

I also really want to learn how design thinking can really elevate businesses around the world, and how to best apply it to socially minded ventures.","I am currently working on an ecommerce I co-founded, Sivenda, in which we help companies in Germany plan advertising campaigns. As part of this business, I am working on creating and designing the website (www.sivenda.de). I plan on changing the color scheme to looking more innovative, like a lighter purple, and also adding a graphic that would look good with our current logo. I also help with picking out which corporate gifts would work well with which company.",,"From a friend through fb messenger, just sent me the link",,04a75a9e-4f6f-46ef-84b6-d85aa7145620

College students everywhere are longing for more hands-on, out of the classroom, real-world learning experiences. 
  
  As a current student, I've leveraged my education through my experience running my own business, The Bridge. I've learned managerial, digital, social, verbal, and design strategy simply from risking my own comfort and starting a business that helps fellow entrepreneurs. Now, I plan on using The Bridge's business model to help educate students like myself by allowing them to operate the company for in-class school credit.
  
  As I prepare to work with University officials on incorporating my current business, The Bridge, around this future education program, Enstitute, the unique need for strategic design is especially present in my life.
  
  The skills I hope to acquire from Designation will directly impact the success and execution of Enstitute, a program that has the potential to radically disrupt entrepreneurial education for the better.","As mentioned, I'm currently directing a retail company called The Bridge. We partner with local entrepreneurs and empower them by connecting their creations to our community. With over 25 unique partners and 35+ employees at The Bridge, I've had to be very strategic and intentional about design. As CMO and Co-Founder, I lead all digital design, managerial design, and storefront design for our disruptive company.

This was because I had friends to show me local spots for hang outs, local eateries and their favorite areas in the city. The app is called ""Roam"" and essentially would have events and suggestions going on in the city. This would introduce travelers to a more genuine traveling experience that would be tailored to their specific interests like live music, open mic, art shows, etc. 
  Since Roam is the name and the logo for the app is the foot of Mercury, the patron of travel, I took design inspirations from Ancient Roman architecture. Because users will be traveling the streets of a particular city, they are ""roaming"" the streets, therefore, typography and font designs are influenced by street designs.

The ability to create different channels is great for segmenting conversations, whereas in a large single-topic group chat it’s very easy for a conversation to go off-course. It’s easy to send files, especially useful since I use it for a class group (sharing notes, study guides, or just embarrassing photos).

I would love to listen to each person’s story and hear about what experiences have molded their values and understand their motivations behind their passions and peeves, and what makes them a unique designer. How we approach problem solving excites me, not the tools we use to solve problems. So from the Designation Conference I don’t expect sparkly new technical skills to be my biggest takeaway, or even adventures to Instagram, or stories I can tell my friends. I want to come back knowing that I’ve taken a big (or even small) step toward becoming the designer and engineer I want to be, having spoken and collaborated with different minds from all across the country. 
  
  I’m passionate about social networks and emotional health, and the problem I’m most interested is social segregation. I was on the Panhellenic Council, the board that governs all sororities, and what we saw was women letting themselves be defined by the letters on their back—and I was once like that too. When I was a freshman, I didn’t get into the sororities that I wanted, so for the next two years I let that define my self-worth. This problem isn’t local to just Greek life, it’s woven throughout all of Penn’s functions: you have to apply to get into that elite Wharton club, you have to be tapped for that elite senior society. These problems seem trivial, but being steeped in a segregating and toxic social environment doesn’t fall away when you put on that graduation cap. It shapes and limits the relationships you form. I want to tackle and take down social segregation, or at least start the conversation about emotional health at Penn. So a while ago I started a project on visualizing my own happiness data and every hour or so I’d record how happy I felt and where on campus I was, to see if there was a correlation between my emotions and my location. From there I wrote a program that translated my data into a 3D height map of campus, with peaks and troughs reflecting my happiness at that space. I want to extend ProjectHappiness to all of Penn’s campus using Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter data to do a more complex emotional breakdown, and to show my peers, you know, “we’re all feeling similar things. it’s okay. you’re not alone.” I’m always trying to find ways top equip my design toolbox, and being around both experienced and fresh minds is one of the most invaluable tools I can think of. I hope that attending the Designation Conference will give me new ideas and new approaches to solve this problem, and challenge how I view designing social good campaigns.","At PennApps a few years ago, my team and I worked on a mobile app called “condoms!” which aimed to combat HIV in Philadelphia (which has 5x the national rate) by aggregating the locations of free condom distribution centers/HIV clinics in an app, data which is public thanks to the OpenDataPhilly Act. My team initially wanted to work on a poorly thought out idea, but I pushed hard for us to spend the first few hours breaking down the HIV problem to three things: poor infrastructure, low public awareness, and a lack of an information pipeline. Once we realized this we designed and implemented an Android app that targeted the last two points, which garnered the attention from judges, who noted our attention to look beyond the nitty-gritty details and think through the bigger picture. But the real innovative part came in the execution and feel of our app that I proposed. Instead of bombarding people with boring images and design that looked like it came out of a 2006 infomercial, I designed our app to be slick, modern, and humorous. There was even a game section where the user could “tap” the condom icon to generate a series of one-liners. The humor and lightheartedness of the app de-stigmatized HIV and was an easy way to get people to talk and laugh, while getting the information on free condoms they need.",,"Daniel Moreno, the HH Design Group, and Design Summer in the Bay Area",:),f313376b-8577-4d7e-863b-e5012774af86

I’ve only seen taxis that were normal cars adapted for public use, but the cabs in London are designed so there are three seats facing forwards, and two back-facing seats that fold up when not in use. It's a pretty simple solution implemented in many trains, but the fact that they are used in taxicabs amazes me. It means getting on and off these cars becomes much easier: you’re able to simply step off the car, there is more legroom with space for suitcases, but a cab can fit up to five passengers.

Some examples include: 1. Mario starts off facing right, showing the player that the game only works when you move right. 2. Two mushrooms appear in the game - one as a villain (gumba) and one as a power-up. The way they look and move give the player an idea of their purpose before the player needs to interact with them. 3. Certain pipes are placed in just the right distance for players to experiment with the button-hold ""long jump"" and if a player falls off a pipe, two gumbas are placed specifically so that the player's momentum will cause them to double jump on them. Both of these smart placements teach the player everything about jump dynamics, point-accumulation, and game world physics. Of course, there are plenty more things that excite me about this stage, but these are the main ones.",I'm in the Facebook group for UX/UI designers.

Approaching the problem with a design thinking strategy, my team of three conducted over 50 ethnographic interviews and chose to focus on one of several community-specific challenges to diabetes management: the difficulty of making adjustments to lower-carbohydrate, lower-glycemic index diets.
  
  Our key insight was that many patients and their families were unwilling to try healthy foods suggested by doctors because the recipes were foreign and unappealing to the community of majority Mexican immigrants. One problem doctors had already identified in particular was the high consumption of corn tortillas, which contain carbohydrates and sugar. After several rounds of ideation and refinement, our team came to a solution that used this ‘problem behavior’ as an asset - a healthy tortilla made with vegetables and bean flour that had the potential to seamlessly integrate into community members’ existing lifestyles and reduce carbohydrate and sugar consumption in diabetic patients’ diets.",,A friend,This seems incredible I really hope you like me!,19d5b259-32bf-46f0-96ee-614254fb0cd9

I also hope to gain more insight into how tech executives view the future of product design and how I can help bridge the gap between design and tech.","For my internship at Microsoft during the summer after my sophomore year, I was lucky enough to be able to design, build and test a product from start-to-finish. The design timeline was my favourite part, as I was able to define the problem well and scale it down to be feasible. My team and I were tasked to build a custom control extension (ex. radio button, toggle control) for Visual Studio Team Services and the only, very general objective was to improve user experience. I was able to define the user objectives more clearly into quantifiable metrics, such as speed and visibility, then create mock-ups to demonstrate to the office. We had to reiterate our designs continuously based on feedback received, then revisit our user objectives.

  I'm not a design student by nature, but I've noticed that Designation has highlighted the need for designers and engineers to collaborate and the importance of the intersection of these two fields. As a web developer, I'm always collaborating with great designers and designing things for other engineers, so the message of the conference is of great interest to me.
  
  Lastly, I look to the conference as my first formal design education experience. I hope to use the breakout sessions and practical workshops can enhance my abilities as a web developer and lead to me developing creatively innovative websites.","As a web developer for Aegis, a non-profit supporting migrant workers' rights in the middle east, I developed a 'life experience' web simulation that allowed users to personally experience and make the daily decisions these migrant workers are faced with on a daily basis, allowing users to understand their struggles and the motivation behind Aegis. 
  
  Conveying such an experience properly required many different skills of mine, from responsive web design to thematic sketches. I was responsible for making the experience feel modern yet thematically sorrow. The result was an immersive story that guided you through the life of migrant workers in the middle east.","In Canada, I believe that the Wealthsimple (https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/) brand is a good example of modern design. Wealthsimple is introducing a newer investment strategy to optimise investment funds, and their brand design reflects that feeling: a modern, infinite scroll website with simple, two-tone design and 3-D animations; high-quality advertisements (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd3MMysL2NE); and a simplistic brand logo.
  
  The combination of all these things makes for a very well-designed brand image.","I was scrolling through Hackathon Hackers and one of your founders, Mihika, posted this there","Having run conferences before, I just want to say it's awesome you've already got so many great speakers for only your first conference :)",f2044e8a-9e01-4e3a-8991-ad783f933336

For example, IM+ on Windows supports Google’s Talk protocol, Facebook messenger and other services, but doesn’t support video calls and doesn’t import your previous messages from those services. Franz on the other hand possesses all said missing features. Franz solves the problem of tab clutter if you’re used to keeping different chat apps open by cleaning them up. The best thing about Franz is that its privacy policy ensures that it doesn’t see anything you send and works basically the same as any web browser would with login information.

Their forms are readable and appealing. The prompts and auto-scrolling makes the experience very intuitive and comforting.

After the conference, I hope to be able to apply the new skills to future entrepreneurial projects I decide to take up.","My first social entrepreneurship project was raising funds for the Singapore Cancer Society. With $1,600 from sponsors, my team raised over $25,000 through the sale of merchandises and concert tickets over summer, promoting awareness for cancer and changing the perception of cancer patients within my society. As the team leader, I based the main message of my project on the story of my alma mater – ex-Raffles girl Joan Chan – in order to appeal to the audience’s emotions. I shared her battle with cancer, where she stayed optimistic after her diagnosis, and expanded the trust fund under her name to help other cancer patients. Instead of emphasizing the depressing side of cancer treatment, I presented an inspirational battle of humanity and the idea that the funds are used to fulfill the dreams of cancer patients by giving them a second chance at life after their diagnosis, alongside the cliché tagline “Cancer is a word not a sentence”, because everyone dreams and will thus be able to relate to them. Even though my project was completed a few years back, I managed to leave a legacy by influencing the current students from my previous school to pick up my project after I left and to continue to spread the story of Joan. Up till now, annual concerts are held and my team’s merchandises are sold to celebrate the bravery of cancer patients and to raise funds for the Singapore Cancer Society.","I feel that Apple is extremely well designed. First of all, the iconic Apple logo is easily recognisable, and Apple products are generally perceived as chic and luxurious. People are willing to pay much more for a sleek MacBook as compared to a normal pc, even though they share similarly features. Furthermore, Apple’s vertical integration strategy from chip design to software and retail, and its horizontal integration strategy across devices and channels (e.g. iPhone and App Store) make its users even more reliant on its products. Consumers are locked into the Apple ecosystem, as they have to continue buying iOS devices if they want to keep their digital purchases. Hence, like many people have said, Apple is like a religion.

First, we had to change the materials and shape due to machining constraints (none of us had a casting foundry in our dorm). A solar charging port was added to due to feedback from users (our roommates). At the end we were so proud of our creation, though looking back it seems more like a collection of fabric, wood and a solar panel thrown together haphazardly.

From there, they developed a wheelchair that can climb stairs, and raise to a vertical height where the user can look a standing human in the eye. The key to design thinking is starting with the right questions, developing user empathy and iterating many many times.

By adding the relationship status, a person can she if he or she is open for a relationship. When I read Mark Zuckerberg's biography, I was astonished by the innovation of this idea. It was game-changing because it grew very rapidly and created connections between people. People could see other people's interests and form connections. The overall structure of Facebook is the type of company I wish to create. It is organized and easy to navigate. Users can easily customize their profile, and the overall design is very appealing. Furthermore, Facebook was created by a couple of college kids without strong knowledge of design thinking. Yet, they were able to create a multi-billion dollar company based off a single and innovative idea.",University of Virginia Career Fair,,00b3423a-2c97-4667-bd4f-8f02d542a712

I love the enchanting experience of using a well-designed product that seems to understand you and provide you with something delightfully useful in exactly the way you need it (or, often more importantly, the way you didn't know you needed it). This is the magic I want to dedicate my life to. Building products and services that help, excite, mystify, intrigue, enchant, and empower is the most fulfilling experience I could imagine.
  
  Designation is somewhere I could actualize this dream. By connecting with current thought leaders, builders, and bankrollers, I could get a comprehensive understanding of the product design process, with all its glories and hurdles, all while meeting some of the undergraduates who will be change agents in years to come. I think this would be an invaluable experience, so I'd be honored by the chance to attend.",,"If This Then That (IFTTT) is my favorite product in the entire world and there are three reasons why. Firstly, it is superbly designed for aesthetic and usability. Not only do the web and mobile apps have stunningly playful and simple interfaces that beg to be interacted with, but the platform allows for a high amount of user variability. On the one hand, IFTTT has high applet customizability for tech-loving product gurus who want to integrate their entire IOT lives. But, it simultaneously has easy-to-build, pre-made applets and recommendation engines to help even the most tech-challenged users reduce product friction across the services of their lives.
  
  Secondly, the platform is highly scalable and promises to become the infrastructure for the IOT ecosystem of the next decade. IFTTT's applet paradigm creates an IOT hub that future products will almost have to go through in order to access their target markets. This mutual product reliance and accessibility makes IFTTT incredibly resistant to obsolescence, and means membership in its community will only increase in value over time (the promise of future services makes user retention a non-issue, even if current service offerings aren't perfectly suited to a user).
  
  Thirdly, IFTTT's monetization strategy is impeccable, allowing it huge flexibility for pricing models and feature design for the foreseeable future. It can monetize in a number of ways: using a ""freemium"" model (power users can pay to access high-level functionality such as multiple action applets), charging for applet construction (charging a service to products that want IFTTT integrability), or user signup bounties (where IFTTT gets paid for users it refers to products in its ecosystem). This variety means IFTTT isn't forced to alienate their users, should the need for money arise (a situation that happens all to often, most notably with Evernote).
  
  Altogether, this make it one of the most sleek, useful, friendly, promising, and altogether well-designed products out there.",University career services,,7664b123-0a03-4f27-93d8-aa26e51bd5fe

I spent weeks on prototyping and wireframes for the website because I knew that the design of the website would drive the whole user experience, and with a saturated market, it was important to create a design that was differentiating, immediately appealing, and easy to use.

Through these events, we gathered and organized data from hundreds of different voices, focused on the students themselves, but supported by the Albemarle school district and other professional educators.

Why? Loyalty. Societal/peer pressure. An established guarantee of quality. The desire to have the latest and greatest. 2) When it boils down to capability vs. accessibility, the latter wins because no matter how many features a product has- they’re rendered useless if the user has now idea how to do their one job: use it. Simply put, people prefer simplicity. A user interface like iOS is so easy to pick up that iPads are even being employed in schools. 3) Sexy snap-fits and flawless fabrication i.e. all those times I’ve accidentally dropped my iPhone only to have it dangle inches from the ground by my earphone cable. Need I say more?","The sweet lady who works at the UVA Career Center sent out an email advertising the conference yesterday (her emails are comparable to clickbait, it's rather impressive).",So I actually submitted an application (literally minutes ago) but I don't think I attached my application.

Since the bike trail was located in a rural area, it would not be possible to run power to the system. Therefore, we used solar panels as a power sources. Another challenge that resulted from the rural location was finding a way to send information between stands. Laying wires between stands would be costly and would deface the natural beauty of the bike trail. Also, there was unreliable cellular service in the area, so we decided to use radio transmitters and receivers. Yet another challenge was portability. We needed to present our project at the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Competition in New York City, which meant that our system had to be light.

Sitting down, the first thing I needed to consider was what I was going to even make. This process required a lot of staring out of the window, and the occasional jotting down of an idea. Eventually, I narrowed my ideas to one: I was going to make a mechanically powered electric generator. When deciding requirements, I had to consider the restrictions. Our engineering course was not amply funded, I had until the end of the school year, and I had access to 3D printers and laser cutters. I decided to isolate the project to a small scale, and focused my goal toward creating a working prototype. As such, it came down to a circuit of a 9 volt DC motor, and an LED lightbulb. I planned to build the apparatus around this circuit. I began a notebook where I took notes on progress and briefly sketched ideas. Quickly, this mechanically powered generator began to look like a foot pedal, so I focused my attention on this design. For the rest of the year, I approached the project keeping the image of a foot pedal in mind. I designed a system of gears on Autodesk Inventor and, in order to test them, laser cut a wooden prototype. When I found that the gears meshed properly, I proceeded to 3D print the design and then attached them to the apparatus. The rest of the project consisted of a similar process of prototyping an isolated system, making changes, applying a final version, and then testing the entire system. This continued until the final prototype was made, and I had successfully made a foot pedal generator that, when stepped on, turned a small system of gears, turned the motor, and briefly lit up the lightbulb.","Japanese pagodas are an engineering feat when considering that around 700 BCE, Japanese engineers did not have access to modern technology to aid in the construction of these vast structures. Instead, they could only utilize geometrical techniques, and decades upon decades of trial and error. I consider the pagoda to be well designed because its structure allowed it to overcome earthquakes. Japan frequently experienced earthquakes which led to civil devastation. As buildings of all kinds cracked and tumbled to the ground, the pagoda remained intact. Engineers at the time found that in order for a building to withstand earthquakes, it needed to be loose. They noticed that buildings rooted to the ground were easily destroyed, and so they built the pagoda with a loose foundation, where the building was simply placed on top of a bed of stone and allowed to shift slightly during an earthquake. Now, instead of having the building shake rapidly in one place during a seismic event, thus damaging the foundation, the building was allowed to shake and move with the quake in order to stay intact. Furthermore, the pagoda was multi-storied. Engineers also realized that when multiple stories were connected to the foundation, a shift of the bottom level during an earthquake would cause a great amount of stress to the upper levels. As such, they found that having unconnected levels stacked upon each other allowed each level to shift independently from the other, thus preventing the lower level from negatively affecting the upper level. Finally, engineers incorporated the infamous shinbashira, a large wooden pole that hanged loosely from the very top of the structure and reached inches above the ground. This pillar swung during an earthquake, creating counteracting forces that allowed the stacked levels and loose foundation to create a stable system. These three designs made up the Japanese pagoda, and are the reason why centuries-old pagodas are still standing today.","A close friend forwarded me the e-mail.

My company's product was a recycled reusable water bottle. The water bottle had a particular design that was sleek and of high quality, with the purpose of supporting health awareness. The main feature of the bottle that made it unique was that it electronically measured the amount of water in ounces that one was drinking each day. It connected to an app on your phone that stored data on your bodies fluid intake. The app, which was called ""H2O Health"" has the ability to connect to the Apple Health app, which monitors physical activity. Additionally, the design of the bottle had a solar powered led screen that displayed the amount of fluid ounces that was intake per day. The screen had a reset button, allowing the measurements to restart each day. This project required design thinking because I needed to differentiate my product from the rest of the reusable water bottle market; and by incorporating digitization to the design of the bottle, I was able to do so.","I interned for Amazon this past summer and I believe their products, brand and experience are all well designed. Particularly, the experience. Amazon's headquarters is in Seattle and I think the urban design and planning of the organization is significant. Amazon has over sixteen high rise office buildings in downtown Seattle. The neighborhood is called South Lake Union and is essentially a campus of Amazon buildings. I believe this urban location and lay out is very well designed because it fosters community and togetherness amongst the corporation. Similarly to many Silicon Valley based technology companies, Amazon has many food courts, courtyards, green spaces and dog parks integrated amongst their campus. Amazon requires intense work hours and the design of the office buildings enable a better work experience. Specifically, it allows an active lifestyle to be incorporated into the long work day. Furthermore, dogs are allowed into the office building and into the desk spaces of the workers. This has proven to make the work place less stressful and more successful. The campus is very walkable with its central proximity, however their is a corporate shuttle that drives around to all of the buildings. Ultimately, the design of the Amazon Headquarters makes for a unique work experience that contributes to Amazon's success in the market and sets it apart from other work environments.",I heard about Designation through the University of Virginia's career center.,I am looking at full time jobs after graduation and the roles I am interested in are heavily product design based.

""FreSh"" stands for ""Free Sh!t"" and the purpose of the app was to show college students where free giveaways were happening on campus (i.e. food, water bottles, etc.). Initially, we focused on the needs of the students and interviewed them about their perspective, because they would be the ones using the app. However, we gradually realized the various student organizations and companies who were advertising their causes were just as important. We then decided to design an app which balanced both perspectives - enabling students to seamlessly discover the various organizations and companies while also earning ""swag"" from them.","""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"" This was the first sentence on Apple's first marketing brochure and it's become the philosophy which has driven Apple to become the most successful consumer product company in history.

The central appeal of simplicity, especially in technology design, is that it gives the user power over the object.

In many of my requirements for the Social Entrepreneurship minor at University of Virginia, I have had the opportunity to learn about the importance of user-focused design and development, whether it be for a product, a service, architecture, or infrastructure. I have had the opportunity to learn design thinking from esteemed professors on the topic like Professor Christine Mahoney of UVA Batten School of Public Policy and Leadership and Professor David Touve of UVA Darden School of Business, both of who taught me that design thinking is even more important when it comes to products or services designed for social impact. Since my prior experience in this area of discipline has been mainly on the classroom level, I hope to learn from Designation how to effectively ideate and effectuate a product or a service from an idea to a prototype, and eventually to an actual product on the market.","In November 2015, the fall of my third year at UVA, I had the heart to design a sanitary pad made out of rubber for women and girls around the world who don't have access to sanitary pad, mainly due to its price.

After a lot of research and interviews with African NGO heads and professors whose expert is in international development and female empowerment, I decided that a sanitary pad made out of rubber could effectively solve this problem. By focusing on users' experience and feedback instead of my own interpretation of the issue, I was able to win the Social Entrepreneurship Track of 2015 UVA Entrepreneurship Cup that year with this idea.","In my personal experience, GoPro is a very well-designed brand and a product.

Right now, the rover control team in Pasadena faces a fundamental human interaction problem—there’s a team of humans (geologists, scientists, rover planners, and engineers) trying to explore an environment through a robot that mechanically “sees” very differently from us. The rover’s 2D cameras can’t afford us the level of spatial and situational awareness that we need to think through 3D problems, like rover navigation. This is especially problematic when we need to navigate uncharted terrain filled with geographical occlusions (mountains, ditches, sand pits, etc.); we’re given inherently imperfect visual data to inform your decision making in a high-risk environment. Risk aversion is fundamental to JPL’s mission.

I had to think through whether or not the user would interact with the dashboard, key insights that they would want to see, and ways to depict the different sensors at various locations.

I'm not referring to diversity between races, genders, or backgrounds (albeit that could be improved as well). There seems to be a consist way of thinking about business, that doesn't take into consideration the amount of work that goes into the process. This conference will force me to consider business, design, and innovation in completely different ways, and that truly excites me.
  
  Through my experience founding a design company and managing a team of students across the country, I know there is a great deal of work that cannot be taught in the business school -- specifically regarding the convergence between good management and great design. Design (anywhere from product design to graphic design) is an integral part of any business, and the sooner that we start looking at design as the first step of the process of developing great minds and ideas, the sooner we can innovate.
  
  I hope to attend designation because it is a place that will be filled with incredible designers, entrepreneurs, and thinkers. The more I can surround myself with the diversity that I referenced at the beginning, the more likely I will be to succeed in my entrepreneurial goals and the more I can do to help my community around me.","In my senior year of high school, I heard of a local coffee shop that was paying thousands of dollars for basic Wordpress development. Knowing that graphic and web design served as a high startup cost to small and growing businesses, I sought to make a difference. The last three years of my academic and professional experience has been dominated by my work in my own business: Fuerza Design
  
  Starting out as a small summer job, this business has proven to be my primary tool for learning how companies operate and how they can positively affect their community. Over the last three years, I have employed eight students around the country, worked with numerous small businesses, and I like to think that we have had a very net positive impact on our community. 
  
  Design has been an integral part of this business. I am of course referring to the actual graphic and web design that we provided to our customers, but also the design of the process. How to set up an internship program, how to effectively manage our sales pipeline, how to ensure that our work was up to standards, it has always been part of our design process.
  
  When other students ask if I am a graphic or web designer, I usually say no. Design is so much more than putting shapes and lines on paper (or a screen), it is a process that affects how we handle every part of our life.",,"I am involved with a club called StartupUW, which promoted the event.","I would like to sincerely thank you all for this opportunity and the time spent reviewing my application.

By conducting surveys, we were able to decide which features to include. With contextual interviews, we were able to evaluate the effectiveness of using a wristband. After initial research, we started wire framing, creating paper prototypes, and then multiple iterations of a digital prototypes based on user feedback during user testing.

Iconic words that are not just associated with a brand, but rather a lifestyle. Since its first creation in 1988 the bold phrase has left their mark on pop culture and athletics.

The phrase has served to motivate not only professional athletes to be bold, but also those aspiring athletes to chase their dreams. As a former athlete myself, Nike was a brand that I always wanted to be wearing. Their products' aesthetics that are closely connected with the iconic phrase made you feel like a world class athlete, capable of taking on the world.

Additionally, I designed the thumbnails of each video in such a way that it's clear who the video is about and what they did.

The backbone of the design methodology was for the user to be able to access their content quickly and efficiently. I demonstrated design thinking during this project by keeping the user at the forefront at every stage of the process. What makes a great UI? This is the question I posed to users through an online survey. Most users responded with ""usability"" or ""adaptability"". One user, however, responded with ""freedom"" and explained that a balanced UI is what makes or breaks the experience. I took these word to heart and decided to act on them to create a more balanced and less confined Home screen Interface that invokes a better sense of flow. 
  
  Secondly I read through Google Play Store comments and interpreted that Android users mostly prefer stock Android.

I find solving problems through design challenging and very interesting and that keeps me motivated. One of the project that I have worked on that involved enhancing and redesigning the search bar results on the Airmiles website. Given that there more than 100000 products to browse through on the website, when the user searches for a potential product, 7+ search results show up in the dropdown of the search. The results are all related to the search and they are varied depending upon the brand, the category etc. The user has to click on every search result to check if they have enough miles ($$ ) to redeem for the product. The task became extremely repetitive as products increased in the list. There were 2 main problems with this design, firstly there was no view all function where user can easily browse through all the results and secondly the price or the number of miles that require to redeem is unclear. To overcome this issue, the solution was designed so that user can view the amount $$ value right beside the result in the dropdown of the search bar itself, so that they can easily find the result of the product. In addition, this also reduces the number of clicks to find the product. As number of clicks reduce the user is more likely to explore more since its a easy path to get to the desired solution. The new design is currently being tested using A/B testing methods.","I believe Starbucks is one of my favorite brand as its well designed because its simple for users to understand and its consistent on all its platforms.

Designation is a great opportunity for me to step out of the bubble that is Waterloo Ontario for a day and network with designers who are a lot better than I am; I'll be able to take away from them things that I wouldn't have figured out as quickly on my own, and devour knowledge like no tomorrow. I hope to learn how to make more meaningful decisions when executing designs with the skills I'll have gained at the conference.","I work at a startup called Gamelynx, a mobile web-based platform for playing online board games with friends. The platform is constantly evolving, so the whole thing is one big project, but right now I'm involved with redesigning the user experience with the goal of improving the feeling of ownership, and implementing a virtual currency. 
  
  This endeavour meant figuring out what was priority in terms of functionality and content, as well as knowing what the technical boundaries are for the engineers. At the same time, I had to keep in mind branding elements that need to persist. 
  
  My take on the project involves many sketches, many, many written notes, and some digital prototyping as well. I've communicated with the engineers that it's probably impossible to completely redesign everything from the ground up and implement it in such a short period of time, so it might be better for me to pump out as many design iterations as I can that will evolve through feedback, and certain features can be implemented. 
  
  Current progress has been great - with just my 2nd mockup done, we've decided on the direction that we want the platform to go towards, figuring out what needs to take absolute priority in the ordering of content and features. It's not just blindly designing; each iteration involves a lot of discussion with the team and user testing, and I'm more than happy to have my design torn apart, because it means I can take the good elements and implement it into an even better iteration.
  
  Designing for this platform is challenging because it's already been established before I was brought on board, but I'm fortunate enough to have a team that embraces change and my opinion, which allows me to make an impact and bring the one step closer everyday to an awesome user experience.",,"I saw a post about it on the HH Design Facebook group, and a friend of mine also mentioned it to me.","This would be an eye-opening experience for me, if I'm selected as a participant.

  Sketch 
  [summer internship at Groupon: my entire PM team used sketch to collaborate with the design team!]","As hinted upon earlier in my application, my fascination and dabbling with design date back to my high school days. Be it while building robots or producing visuals for musicals, I’ve always been excited about how to design experiences that elevate how people feel when they interact with it. My first foray into product design was during my first hackathon in Freshmen year. We built a platform to connect local talent with projects requiring diverse technical experiences, and ended up winning the Best Design Award! However, ever since then, since I’ve been focusing on growing as a leader & learning more about the world of product management (which I’ve been lucky to stumble upon), I haven’t had a chance to further hone in on the tools of the trade in today’s world of design.
  
  In my summer internship at Groupon last year, my manager (https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahsw/) shared a piece of feedback with me in our first 1-1 that I totally didn’t see coming: he usually was the ‘bar raiser’ in recruiting processes, and had recommended hiring me because he had been impressed by my eye for design in my interview with him. Apparently, I had a stronger design sense than most full-time PM candidates he had interviewed! :O I shrugged his praise off, thinking he probably told me that to make me feel comfortable in my first week.
  
  However, that encounter with Noah did further fuel my desire to learn more about design, but I suppressed it because despite of what Noah had said, I felt scared that I wouldn’t be good enough. Luckily, I recently watched Design Disruptors, and it transformed my perspective on the art of design - I realized it actually involved many of the things I love to do, and is a lot about mindset and thinking! In my most recent recruiting season, I was selected to interview with Shopify for a design internship - I was genuinely surprised as to why they even wanted to talk to someone who didn’t have a proper design portfolio! They told me they believed in hiring for potential, and were interested in my encounters with design in my past experiences… although I didn’t end up getting the offer (duh, I didn’t have a portfolio yet!), that was a pivotal moment.
  
  I realized I would regret not exploring & embracing design - I had experienced the magic of design in bits and pieces, but I want to actually be able to drive change with this magic! (be it starting my own company to transform an industry, building technology products pro-bono for NPOs & social good, or even creating communities around causes…) To make this happen, I am going to be taking a year off from university to further dive into the world of design - armed with my newfound confidence, I realized succeeding in becoming a design-driven leader had to start with 3 things: my commitment to work hard to learn the tools of the trade, the belief that I can do it, and finally, attending Designation 2017. ;) I can’t wait to get started.",,"If language is what brings people together, then design is the language that connects technology with people. Airbnb is an exemplary example of this. The brand’s primary goal is to evoke a sense of belonging anywhere you go. The moment you enter their experience, you’re ricocheted into a world of thoughtful animations and copy - it is amidst this that you are then guided to marvel at the accommodations that await. It’s almost as if you are transported to your destination! Airbnb’s product empowers every user to feel welcome, share what makes them special & connect on a deeper level than on any other marketplace. What sets them apart is this sense of trust and community that is instilled in every touchpoint. 
  
  I was especially impressed by how they approached the design challenge of preventing hosts & guests from gaming the review system in their early days. If one party could see the review of the other party before they completed their own side of the story, there would be opportunity to taint opinions based on what the other party said. To bring out authentic reviews, Airbnb implemented a delay in the review flow - both guests & hosts would be able to independently review each other in a fixed time period, but after that no reviews would be accepted. Only if both parties reviewed each other, would their reviews be revealed and displayed. Furthermore, with their recent release of Lottie (a library that helps add pro AE animations natively into an app), Airbnb has further demonstrated their commitment to building an experience that delights.",Coincidence: Saw a post shared by Chen Ye on my timeline on Facebook!

It's a brand that is never compromising because the leaders behind it are product centric designers. Combining high functionality with clothing from something out of a cyber-punk dystopia, ACRONYM's key trait is that it is a brand with an unbreakable vision. Although the brand features price points that are seemingly outrageous (sometimes over 1,000 usd!), it's almost helped in creating a community around the brand. Because they are so uncompromising, they attract a consumer- no, audience, that believes in their vision of clothing. However, that same unbending will also creates an absurd price point for their consumer. In the same way, it also creates a bond between the brand and the consumer, because they know that ACRONYM will always stay true to their vision. This then allows ACRONYM to go ""all-out"" and create to their full potential knowing that their audience will be receptive to their creations. 
  
  For a brand to be well designed, it also needs to know what their user is doing. ACRONYM does not design for the product, ACRONYM designs for what the product allows you to do. In all of ACRONYM's videos for their products, they focus on what you can do with the product. They focus on the movements of the human body and how their fabrics, while utilitarian, allow for these movements and customizations (https://vimeo.com/47598498). ACRONYM has a clear vision for why people buy into the brand and why they want to wear ACRONYM.","The Facebook group, HH Design","Cheers for reading this and coming to the end, I hope you enjoyed my little write-up, and I hope to hear back from you guys in the future!",fe365ba9-3283-43cb-8fce-81de781a7bef

So, we decided to approach the problem by creating a food ordering app that focuses on using visual images to enhance the mobile food ordering experience — especially the creation of custom orders.

We approached the user testing through a narration and observation method and documented it on video.

It is multifunctional yet space efficient since they are relatively small in size. A convection toaster oven can act as an oven, a toaster, a broiler or it can simply heat up food. It is easy for users to learn how to use them since their buttons and dials utilize text, numbers and icons to communicate their functions. For example, usually their toaster dial illustrates toasting intensity by using a piece of bread that is outlined, one that it half filled in and one that is fully filled in.

Collecting and tracking the frequency of a patient’s repeated questions allows researchers to measure the patient’s cognitive ability. 
  One of the design decisions that we made was to always ask for patient’s consent before collecting any data, as the user is always at the centre of user experience design. 
  Another design decision we had to make was the type of data researchers should collect from the patient and how to display the information using data visualization for researchers to understand and analyze in a meaningful way. We found that researchers have a tough time getting a large volume of data in the dementia field and they would appreciate tools and graphs that would help them pinpoint the data on a top down view of how certain collective demographics of dementia patients are doing compared to the frequency of their questions. I then thought of displaying the data in a scatterplot and this will give a visual of a “spike” in patients’ dementia journey making it easier to uncover insights to how a collective demographic is responding in their dementia journey.",,I heard about Designation from my hackathon team member.,,738e29bf-476b-4946-b90a-1990c41f83ea

Yet, it was not until I spoke at the UN about global hunger that I realized the privilege that allowed me to speak also obligated me to act. 
  I discovered human-centred design and immediately saw its value for wicked problems. I took online courses offered by IDEO. I devoured design literature, from Design Anthropology to Change by Design. As a testament to complete audacity, I applied — two months late — for an Impact Design fellowship with Net Impact, and was successful. 
  Most importantly, I was simultaneously applying my learning. Before even stepping foot in London, I ideated with dozens of local stakeholders to prototype ReHarvest. It was incredible to construct a meaningful picture of food systems through lived perspectives and pain points acquired through design research, and fulfilling to then design a venture niche.

I was responsible for designing a Target Operating Model (TOM). The design thinking in this “business design” was critical to transforming the bank to become more modern. I had to interview the key employees (Users) affected by technology change to gain a strong understanding of their needs, map out the processes in place and strategize ways of interaction (Storyboarding), structure initial recommendations (Low-fi), and ultimately provide a recommendation to executives on the best transition points and processes to put into place in the form of a polished deliverable (High-fi).

  The biggest design challenge that I've faced so far is finding creative ways to convey a large chunk of information generated by our algorithm since the itinerary incorporates flights, hotels, attractions, and times.

Engineering guest experience is essential to creating that emotional connection that motivates consumers of all ages to be drawn to Disney. From pumping vanilla scents down Main Street to having guests enter through a portal, customers are transformed into a world of happiness and it’s paying off big time.

Using Johnny Cash's live album ""At Folsom Prison"" as a lens for prison representation, I created both a digital and physical iteration of the project. My digital project was a tumblr that juxtaposed prison images from pop culture with more realistic depictions, questioning who actually knows what prison is like. My physical project was a sculpture; a bulbous white dome made of papier-mache sat on a pedestal with a set of earbuds. For the music, I isolated moments in the titular track of Cash's album where prisoners could be heard clearly, and those sounds played on loop. There was a small slot on the sculpture, calling to mind a slot on a prison door for food, and although you could not clearly see the inside of the sculpture, it gave a claustrophobic effect.",,a friend,,ab6bf961-8eba-4876-91bd-55dbda5bf208

  My passion is designing and creating applications that will help people that lack the resources to help themselves. In places around the world like Kiribati, there are people that are leapfrogging into the age of technology; however, the physical infrastructure, including power and internet, is often deficient. As a result, many apps that enhance our day-to-day lives simply aren't able to be used in these places even if they're 'designed' to help. 
  
  I want to change that. At Designation, I'd like to join the conversation by breaking down the ""user"" we're designing for. How does that user live? What thoughts are going through their minds every day? How do we take into account the physical environment they're living in and improve on it?

  It has one function: to write, and it has been in its modern form for more than 400 years. All over the world, people use the pencil to put their thoughts to paper. No matter if you're an astronaut in outer space, a general plotting troop movements, or a student sketching designs, each person is able to use the pencil for their needs. The modern pencil is simple, affordable, reliable, and efficient.
  
  With new apps and devices, there's often been a desire to cram multiple features into one single product, whether it's attaching a stylus to the back of a pen, or creating an erasable pen. Instead, I propose a focus on simplicity. Why should we seek to combine two unsatisfying features rather than promote one quality feature?

In setting up this project, I had to invent an effective way for the mice to be exposed to various sound stimuli while I record their neural activity via calcium imaging. I needed to build a maze that features tunnels through which directional speakers could play back sound. I constructed a program in MatLab to output sound files through a driver and went to Yale's Center for Engineering Innovation and Design to make my maze blueprint come to life at the machine shop. I had to iron out the kinks after some tests and redesigned the maze to be tighter and sloped, so that mice would have to exert effort to ""approach"" speakers intentionally, rather than at random.

No frills should divert attention from the facts, but the visual theme must be elegant enough to attract the tired gaze. Negative space is key; limit the word count, and ensure that each figure is easily discernible. Do not surprise the audience. Simply direct their attention with tasteful transitions and simplified diagrams, perhaps highlighted by a clean color palette. An excellent visual theme is one that does not distract, but rather conveys the information with integrity and distinction. Perhaps these thoughts do not embody the STEM perspective — nonetheless, my efforts to integrate these seemingly polarized aspects of my life have come to define the way in which I approach the world.",,Through a friend at Yale,Thank you for organizing this conference!

The pedal box presented a very interesting challenge as it was assigned to me two weeks before we were scheduled to start testing. The first step was to understand how much braking force we needed so that I could spec the master cylinders and understand the range of pedal ratios available to us. To address the ergonomics, I mocked up a pedal box using acrylic so we could get an idea of the pedal position, angle and height we wanted. Once the ergonomics were locked in, I made design for manufacturability my #1 priority. Using commercially available shapes and as little 3rd axis CNC machining as possible, I got the pedal box done in under ten days.","I am amazed by my parents’ 1987 Miele dishwasher for two reasons: it works, and it works well. Since they first purchased it, the dishwasher has seen my parents move to different cities and a different country, and it has been (and still is) their daily dishwasher. What is most amazing is that the gaskets still hold up, there are no leaks or clogs, all the water lines are working perfectly fine, all of the electronics are working (mind you, it has capacitive touch buttons for program selection – originals from 1987) and it cleans the dishes well. And it never feels like it’s from 1987: it has removable compartments for cutlery, accommodates plates, bowls, pans and pots of different sizes and it even has a plate-warmer program.

After observing current design thinking curricula at the local public school, we discovered that some of roadblocks students face when creating a project involve tactile tasks (folding, cutting). Taking this into consideration, we created a product that involves building from unit blocks. Inspired by New Haven’s urban environment, I suggested a game that involved reconstructing areas of the city using the blocks as buildings to create a map. To increase the difficulty of the kits and help the students develop spatial reasoning skills, we created a grid with directions that they had to follow. The kit will also allow students to practice with their understanding of geometry and orienteering and exercise their puzzle-solving skills. Our prototype will be tested with the students in April.",,I was referred by a Studio Lead from Yale's Design for America club.,"I’m very interested in learning how design-thinking can be most effectively taught to students of all backgrounds.

Through my experience building the low-cost kit for elementary students, I began to wonder who design thinking caters to, and whether it can benefit people who face all different kinds of challenges.
